## DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF A SIMPLE SCREW CONVEYOR 
A better design of screw feeders for spacific materrials by using discrete element method (DEM) was proposed by Justin W. Fernandee et al. [8] to stimulate the particle transport in horizontal screw feeder system. Dixit et al. [9] determined the effect of percent trough load on horizontal screw conveyor.

 · Screw Conveyor Corporation. The capacity of a Screw Conveyor should be defined in terms of cubic feet per hour. It is also important to deter-mine the maximum capacity the conveyor will be required to handle. This capacity is very often stated in terms of tons or pounds per hour. However the material to be handled often varies in density.
