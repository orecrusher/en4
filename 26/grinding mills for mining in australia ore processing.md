This introduction of microcracks into an ore is called 'pre-weakening' and significantly improves ore grindability offering up to 50% increase in JKMRC Ab value and a 25% decrease in the BWI. SELFRAG Can optimise this process to reduce grinding energy consumption and wear of grinding media or increase mill throughput by up to 30%.

## Autogenous Grinding 
Autogenous Grinding - Mining Fundamentals. Autogenous grinding is a process of grinding ore in a rotating cylinder using large pieces of the same ore. Autogenous mills operate mechanically like ball mills; however the media used for grinding differs. Simply put in autogenous grinding the media is also the material that is being ground

## Grinding 
Grinding is a significant and critical part of the ore winning process. On average milling is the process that requires the most energy in the whole mining operation. To ensure profitable operations an efficient grinding circuit has to be designed especially now where global mineral resources are decreasing and the exploitation of low-grade deposits become necessary.

 · Fine grinding to P80 sizes as low as 7 μm is becoming increasingly important as mines treat ores with smaller liberation sizes.This grinding is typically done using stirred mills such as the Isamill or Stirred Media Detritor. While fine grinding consumes less energy than primary grinding it can still account for a substantial part of a mill's energy budget.
