## Analyzing the 10 Deadliest Mining Hazards 
 · Powered Haulage in Coal Mines Powered haulage collisions killed 21 workers in coal mines between 2011 and 2015. As mines have increased in size in recent years so have the size and number of machines used to transport people materials waste and supplies. As a result powered haulage is routinely among the deadliest hazards in coal mines.
