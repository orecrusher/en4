In the Java Edition copper ore tries to generate 6 times per chunk in groups from zero to sixteen in layers 0 to 96 being more common in layers 47 and 48 and less common at the ends. Copper ore can replace stone granite diorite andesite tuff and deepslate.Copper ore rarely replaces deepslate and tuff generating

## Basics of an open pit mine 
Open pit mines can be used in coal mining and they are used extensively in "hard rock" mining for ores such as metal ores copper gold iron aluminum and many minerals. In a open pit coal mine the pit bottom would be the bottom mined coal seam elevation since it is usually feasible to extract multiple seams when surface mining coal.

## Copper mining. Introduction.
Mining copper: About 200 years ago the UK was an important world source of copper and there were mines in Cornwall and Wales. These mines have now closed and today the biggest copper mines are in Chile and North America. These produce many thousands of tonnes of copper ore per year. The main ores of copper are: chalcopyrite bornite malachite.
