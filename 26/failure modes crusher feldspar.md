## Failure to adequately maintain crushers comes at a high price
 · Crushers operate at high power force and capacity in order to produce the required materials. This puts a great deal of strain on the crusher and its wear parts which operators must be aware of when carrying out maintenance. Failure to do so may have a high impact both in terms of financial cost and potential loss of production.

## Discussion: A probabilistic approach to sand particle 
Thus single particle crushing will not always have resulted in an ideal tensile failure and the crushing mode will have been statistically dependent on the distribution of grain shapes. The strength properties from the plate loading tests are not likely to follow a Weibull distribution based simply on tensile failure but will incorporate statistical variabilities because of the above factors.

Generally speaking: 1/3 fail due to fatigue 1/3 fail due to lubriion problems (wrong lubricant wrong quantity wrong lubriion interval) 1/6 fail due to contamination

## Types Of Column Failure 
1- Compression Failure. When columns are axially loaded the concrete and steel will experience some stresses. When the loads are greater in amount compared to the cross-sectional area of the column the concrete and steel will reach the yield stress and failure will be starting without any later deformation.

 · Properly derate VFDs. Preventing faults and failures starts by right-sizing the VFD for the machine task. Single-phase input voltage on a VFD with 3-phase input is common in many automation appliions. Depending on the horsepower and voltage rating drives can accept single-phase input voltage without derating the output current.
