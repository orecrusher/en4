Stainless steel (SS) is alloy steel with a minimum chromium content of 10.5 % or more and maximum carbon content of less than 1.20%. SS has excellent resistance to corrosion and good ductility. Stainless steel becomes corrosion resistive due to the formation of non-reactive chromium oxide (Cr2O3) film that adheres tightly to the surface of the metal.
