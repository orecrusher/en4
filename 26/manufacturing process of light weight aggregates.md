Our lightweight aggregates from Lytag® are made from fly ash generated by coal fired power stations. Our technology heats the fly ash to 1100°C to create a hard pellet with a honeycombed internal structure. Which can then be used as a superior lightweight aggregate which is up to 50% lighter than natural aggregate.

## Paper Sludge Reuse in Lightweight Aggregates Manufacturing
The lightweight aggregates used by the civil engineering market are sintered at a high temperature about 1200 °C. In times of high energy prices and regulation of carbon dioxide emissions lightweight aggregate products of the high-temperature process in sales marketing are not readily accepted. This study developed a sintered-type paper sludge lightweight aggregate.
