 · Portland cement is the most common type of cement in the world. It is used primarily to make concrete mortar and grout. Portland cement manufacturing begins with mining and then grinding raw materials that include limestone and clay to a fine powder called raw meal which is then heated to a sintering temperature as high as 1450 °C in a cement kiln.

Generally speaking food drying is the least damaging form of food preservation. Here are some specifics: ♦ Vitamin A is retained during the drying process. ♦ The caloric value of a fresh food stays the same when it is dried. Some dried foods fruits for example taste sweeter because the water has been removed and the sugar is concentrated.

## Clinker quality depends on raw material composition.
 · Portland cement is the most common type of cement in the world. It is used primarily to make concrete mortar and grout. Portland cement manufacturing begins with mining and then grinding raw materials that include limestone and clay to a fine powder called raw meal which is then heated to a sintering temperature as high as 1450 °C in a cement

Dry Process for Manufacturing of Cement Dry Process for Manufacturing of Cement. The dry material undergoes a series of chemical reactions in the hottest part of the kiln and some 20 to 30 percent of the material becomes liquid and lime silica and alumina recombine. The fused mass turns fuses into balls of diameter 3 to 25 mm known as clinker.

## Raw Material Handling and Storage 
 · In a sense raw materials used in concrete are just like the food we eat: They should be of good quality they must be stored and handled properly and they must not be contaminated. The old adage "You are what you eat" comes to mind because the quality of raw materials going into a concrete mix has a direct effect on how the final product will turn out – in both fresh and hardened states.
