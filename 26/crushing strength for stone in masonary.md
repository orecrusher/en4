When the masonry is of cut stone xvith thin joints and cement mortar the strength of the masonry may be proportioned to the strength of the stone. For rubble with thick joints the strength of the stone has no material effect upon the strength of the masonry. The loads used in practice vary quite widely according to the views of the designers.

Stones laid in masonry are said to crack with about half their ultimate crushing strength.1 Experiments made upon brick piers 12 inches square and from 2 to 10 feet high laid in mortar composed of one volume of Portland cement and two of sand show that the strength per square inch of the masonry is only about ¬£ of the strength of the brick

## The Complete Guide to Crushed Stone and Gravel
¬†¬∑ Crushed stone: If you hear the generic "crushed stone" term it usually refers to stone that has a mixture of stone dust in it. This type of stone is best used for a base when heavy compaction is needed. As a result it is typically used for the base of concrete and paving projects foundations of structures and driveway bases.

## Types Of Mortar Masonry Walls
¬†¬∑ Type M (min 2500 PSI): Most commonly used with stone type M mortar is one of the strongest variations. Type M mortar mimics the strength of stone. This type of mortar may be recommended for masonry units with high compressive strength as well as for projects in which you are working against gravity or with more extreme lateral loads.
