## Flaky gold: Problems with recovery and mineralogical 
Mineralogical studies have consistently revealed that flaky gold is common in the tailings from both gravity and flotation circuits where it can be a significant contributor to losses. A combination of case study and laboratory data has been used to illustrate the extent and causes for problems associated with flaky gold. An additional problem is encountered when trying to quantify gold

## Morphological and chemical assessment of alluvial gold 
Placer gold is widely distributed in southwestern Cameroon but no known lode sources have been uncovered possibly because of intense weathering. In this study the morphology and microchemistry of alluvial gold from Ako'ozam and Njabilobe were investigated to understand the nature of the source mineralization. SEM QEMSCAN and EMPA methods were employed to characterize morphology
