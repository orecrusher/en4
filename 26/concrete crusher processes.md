Carbonation is a slow and continuous process that progresses from the outer surface moving inwards. Over the lifecycle of concrete carbonation will result in the reabsorption of around a third of the CO2 emitted when making cement significantly reducing the whole-life CO2 footprint of both the cement and the concrete for which it is used.
