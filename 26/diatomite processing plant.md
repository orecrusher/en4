Diatomite does not need to be blasted as it is a soft friable ore. The stockpiled material is then hauled to the processing plant for crushing drying milling and often calcining. Going into the crusher the pieces may be as large as a small car but coming out they will be the size of a pea. At this point the ore will still contain moisture.
