## DRI production 
DRI production. Direct reduction of iron is the removal of oxygen from iron ore or other iron bearing materials in the solid state i.e. without melting as in the blast furnace. The reducing agents are carbon monoxide and hydrogen coming from reformed natural gas syngas or coal. Iron ore is used mostly in pellet and/or lumpy form.

## How is iron extracted using a blast furnace?
 · Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions. See further detail related to it here.
