## 6 Potential Environmental Effects of Uranium Mining 
Although 90-95 percent of the uranium in the ore is extracted during processing (thus reducing uranium concentrations by at least an order of magnitude) most of the uranium decay products (e.g. 230 Th 226 Ra 222 Rn) which may comprise the majority of the total radioactivity of the ore stay in the tailings (Hebel et al. 1978 Van Metre and Gray 1992).

 · Between this two uranium-238 is more stable while uranium-235 undergoes fission more readily and is therefore the most common fuel used in nuclear power reactors. The three uranium isotopes are distributed in the earth's crust with remarkable uniformity so that any uranium ore mined today will contain exactly 0.72 percent of uranium-235.

Uranium was originally found as a bi- product of Radium and Vanadium mining. As the need for uranium increased uranium specific mines were opened. However these mines became more and more expensive as shallow high grade deposits became depleted and the cost of mining equipment transportation and regulations increased.

## How is uranium made into nuclear fuel 
After mining the ore is crushed in a mill where water is added to produce a slurry of fine ore particles and other materials. The slurry is leached with sulfuric acid or an alkaline solution to dissolve the uranium leaving the remaining rock and other minerals undissolved.

 · Prior to the start of mining the first ore body it was necessary for Susquehanna-Western Inc. to drill 15000 feet of exploratory holes to delineate the mining area. After this was completed the DRD Construction Company of San Antonio removed over 300000 tons of earth to reach the ore.

## Uranium Mining Overview 
Most of the uranium ore deposits at present supporting these mines have average grades in excess of 0.10% of uranium – that is greater than 1000 parts per million. In the first phase of uranium mining to the 1960s this would have been seen as a respectable grade but today some Canadian mines have huge amounts of ore up to 20% U average grade.

As I researched other Navajo communities that had past uranium mining I found they all had a similar story. They all had relatives that were former miners or lived nearby an abandoned uranium mine who died of cancer.
