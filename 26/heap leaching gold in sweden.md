## Gold Heap
Gold Heap-Leach Modeling Project Description. Itasca developed a numerical model to estimate gold (Au) production from heapleach operations. The objective was to simulate Au heap leaching using a model based on fluid flow and mass-transport (hydrodynamic modeling) in a partially saturated pad and quantitatively assess monthly production of gold-cyanide production (AuCN).

Heap leaching is a low-cost technology used in industrial mining to recover precious metals such as gold and uranium along with several other highly sought after metals like copper from their primary resources (ores and minerals). For many decades there has been a growing demand for heap leaching due to its environmental benefits. Heap leaching provides mining operators with a benign

Heap leaching has emerged as the safest and most efficient ways to mine the lower grade gold that was uneconomical in the past. It is a flexible and continuously evolving extraction technology which gained popularity in the 1980's when gold prices rocketed from $35 to $800. Developers and miners took advantage of the higher prices and opened

## What is Heap Leaching? (with picture) 
Heap leaching is an industrial process for extracting precious metals and minerals by dissolving them from ore with liquids known as leaching solutions. The process is commonly used to extract metals such as gold copper and uranium yellowcake in addition to several other minerals.

 · According to a press-release cyanide leaching of the material in the trial ROM leach pad took place over 81 days resulting in recoveries of 75.12% for gold and 12.37% for silver. The company said that these results compare favorably with those from the August 2019 PFS which assumed crushing material to a size of 4 inches with recoveries of 75% for gold and 10% for silver.
