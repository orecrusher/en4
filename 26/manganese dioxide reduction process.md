Therefore these processes may not be suitable for use in colder climates. Theoretically at 68°F the carbon dioxide content of the water can be reduced to 0.5 ppm by aeration to equilibrium conditions. This is not always practical from an economic standpoint and reduction of carbon dioxide to 10 ppm is normally considered satisfactory.
