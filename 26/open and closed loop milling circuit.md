## CNC Control 
Closed-looped systems would naturally require more control devices and circuitry in order for them to implement both position and velocity control. This obviously makes them more complex and more expensive than the open-loop system. A closed/open comparison is shown below.

## Cooling towers with open closed or hybrid cooling circuit 
Closed circuit cooling towers; There is no direct contact between the water to cool down and the air inside closed circuit cooling towers but an additional heat exchanger is however used. Cooling towers with piping and plate heat exchanger also exist. A cooling tower is a heat exchanger that uses the direct contact with the air to cool down water.

## The Basics of Current Sensors 
 · . Current sensors are either open- or closed-loop. Open-loop current sensors measure AC and DC currents and provide electrical isolation between the circuit being measured and the output of the sensor (the primary current is measured without electrical contact with the primary circuit providing galvanic isolation).

## Difference Between Open Loop Closed Loop 
One of the significant difference between the open loop and closed loop control system is that in an open loop system the desired output does not depend on the control action. While in the closed loop system the desired output depends on the control action of the system. The other differences between the open and closed loop system are shown below in the comparison chart.

## closed loop amplifier 
Non-inverting voltage feedback reduces non-linear distortion because the feedback stabilizes the closed-loop voltage gain making it almost independent of the changes in open-loop voltage gain. As long as loop gain is much greater than 1 the output voltage equals 1/B times the input voltage. this implies that output will be a more faithful reproduction of the input.

the mill discharge from ball mill 1 will increase. With the same water addition to sump 1 the particle size of Cyclone 1 overflow will increase. This will decrease the ratio and hence the control loop will add more water to keep the ratio constant. However the amount of slurry reporting as fresh feed to the second milling circuit will increase.
