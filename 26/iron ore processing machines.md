## iron processing 
iron processing - iron processing - Ores: Iron ores occur in igneous metamorphic (transformed) or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary but many have been changed by weathering and so their precise origin is difficult to determine. The most widely distributed iron-bearing minerals are oxides and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3) which is

Iron ore is the unrefined substance utilized to formulate pig iron which is one of the most important untreated materials to compose steel. 98% of the hauled out iron ore is used to produce steel. Uncontaminated iron ore is almost nameless on the exterior of the Earth apart from the combination of Fe-Ni alloys from meteorites and very atypical forms of unfathomable mantle xenoliths.
