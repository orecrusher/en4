## Do you know coal ash is more Radioactive than Nuclear 
 · The scary thought about nuclear energy is that it's so so dangerously radioactive. Isn't it? Well no. This fact proved to be wrong: The waste produced by coal power plants is more radioactive than nuclear waste. Who would have thought? When coal burns in power plants to create energy the waste that is left is called fly ash.

 · Among the surprising conclusions: the waste produced by coal plants is actually more radioactive than that generated by their nuclear counterparts. In fact the fly ash emitted by a power plant—a by-product from burning coal for electricity—carries into the surrounding environment 100 times more radiation than a nuclear power plant producing the same amount of energy.

## What is Coal Ash 
 · Even nuclear fuel cycle releases less radiation into the environment than coal cycle and any other major energy source. The problem is coal itself and especially coal ash (fly ash). Coal a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock contains a substantial amount of the radioactive elements uranium and thorium.

## Coal Ash Is More Radioactive than Nuclear Waste « Isegoria
Coal Ash Is More Radioactive than Nuclear Waste according to Scientific American: [T]he waste produced by coal plants is actually more radioactive than that generated by their nuclear counterparts. In fact fly ash — a by-product from burning coal for power — contains up to 100 times more radiation than nuclear waste.
