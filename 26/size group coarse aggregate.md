## Which Size Of Aggregate Divides Coarse From Fine Aggregate
Aggregates - Types of Aggregates CoarseTypes of aggregates include Coarse aggregate and fine aggregate. The aggregate of each type is further sub-divided into many types and classifiion based on its size. The technique of Sieve Analysis is used for gradation of aggregate for use in concrete and for other appliions.

## Coarse aggregate in concrete 
Coarse aggregate may be available in several different size groups such as 19 to 4.75 mm (3/4 in. to No. 4) or 37.5 to 19 mm (1-1/2 to 3/4 in.) Using larger coarse aggregate typically lowers the cost of a concrete mix by reducing cement requirements the most costly ingredient.

Gravels constitute the majority of coarse aggregate used in concrete with crushed stone making up most of the remainder. Natural gravel and sand are usually dug or dredged from a pit river lake or seabed. Crushed aggregate is produced by crushing quarry rock boulders cobbles or large-size gravel.

The Coarse Aggregate Test (ASTM C127 and AASHTO T 85) is simply a volume determination by displacement of water. A basic test can be performed with a woven-wire basket and water container or the complete test can be performed more efficiently using a specific gravity bench for suspended weighing of the specimen from an electronic balance.
