Gold is mined from veins by putting the rocks in a machine that crushes the rocks then adding an acid that eliminates everything but the gold. Then they just have the gold flakes. Gold is mined from placer deposits by going downstream of the river and using a sifter pan to separate the gold flakes from the sands and pebbles.
