Quantifying sub-micrometer particles in protein therapeutics is a potential of the FFF technique that is yet to be realized due to the lack of detection with sufficient sensitivity. In this article the effect of several important parameters on the optimization of FFF analyses are explored and the strengths weaknesses and potential new appliions of the technique are discussed.
