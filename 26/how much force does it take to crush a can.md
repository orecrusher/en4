## How much pressure does it take to crush a car?
It depends on the car and how compressed "crushed" is but a ball park answer follows. Pressure is force divide by an area (F/L^2). A typical person can sit on a car and not crush it (~5 to 20 psi (pounds per square inch.)). To crush the car would require more pressure so 100 to 500 psi would provide a range of crushed levels of a car.

Lets say shattering is a mean particle size of 2 in or 5 cm. We can back into it which would be a powderfactor of 2.5kg/m 3 which means 2.5kg of blastex. We go back to the energy density of 740 cal/g which converts to joules / kg since we have 2.5kg we need joules of energy to shatter that 1 m 3 rock. 2.
