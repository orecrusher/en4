Cadmium rarely appears in nature and is most commonly sourced by its removal from zinc metals during the refining process.

## Heavy Metals 
Introduction. The term heavy metal refers to any metallic chemical element that has a relatively high density and is toxic or poisonous at low concentrations. Examples of heavy metals include mercury (Hg) cadmium (Cd) arsenic (As) chromium (Cr) thallium (Tl) and lead (Pb).. Heavy metals are natural components of the Earth's crust. They cannot be degraded or destroyed.
