At Gasser mining of raw materials has been greatly reduced by substitut-ing quarried materials with waste materials. Nevertheless quarry operations require great attention in the fu-ture in order to further minimize the impact. A measure to reduce the impact of the mining operations is to rebuilt mining areas at the end of their useful life.

Introduction. Sand and gravel are used extensively in construction. In the preparation of concrete for each tonne of cement the building industry needs about six to seven times more tonnes of sand and gravel (USGS 2013b). Thus the world's use of aggregates for concrete can be estimated at 25.9 billion to 29.6 billion tonnes a year for 2012 alone.
