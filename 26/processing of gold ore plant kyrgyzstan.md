## Gold Recovery And How To Choose The Right Process 
Refractory Gold. The last type of gold deposit is called refractory gold and it is the most difficult type to extract. It can be defined as any ore that responds poorly to a conventional gravity-cyanidation process with examples including copper porphyry complex sulfides arsenopyrite and lead-zinc associations.
