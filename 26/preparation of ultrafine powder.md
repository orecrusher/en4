## Preparation of Ultrafine W Powder via Carbothermic 
A two-step reduction method to synthesize tungsten powder with controllable size is proposed. Firstly precursors composed of W and WO 2 were synthesized via carbothermic prereduction of tungsten trioxide with different C/WO 3 ratios at 1323 K then the precursors were completely reduced by hydrogen to remove residual oxygen at 1023 K and 1223 K respectively.
