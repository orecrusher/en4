## How do electromagnetic vibratory feeder works — MP Elettronica
 · The vibration of an electromagnetic feeder is generated as the alternating electrical current moves back and forward through the wires of the coil. As the current moves in one direction the coil attracts the magnet and adds tension to the springs. When the current switches direction the magnet is released and the potential energy stored as tension in the springs is used to move the tray.
