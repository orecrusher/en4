## Future of Cement: Low
 · Some of the leading cement producers across the globe are working to develop breakthrough technologies that can produce superior quality cement with greater energy efficiency and reduced emissions. LafargeHolcim in partnership with an American start-up Solidia Technologies has developed a novel form of concrete that reduces the overall carbon footprint by up to 70%.

## Cement 
Portland cement the most common type of cement in general use around the world as a basic ingredient of concrete mortar stucco and non-speciality grout was developed in England in the mid 19th century and usually originates from limestone. James Frost produced what he called "British cement" in a similar manner around the same time but did not obtain a patent until 1822.

## Laying the foundation for a zero
 · Carbon-cured concrete. This technology injects CO 2 captured during cement production to accelerate the curing process and "lock in" CO 2 in the end product. Current low-carbon cement technologies can sequester up to 5 percent of CO 2 with the potential of 30 percent.

## How Cement Is Made
Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains. The cement is now ready for transport to ready-mix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects. Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement some kilns in the United States use a wet process.
