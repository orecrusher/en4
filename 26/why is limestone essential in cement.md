## The role of calcium carbonate in cement hydration 
 · Limestone mainly consisting of calcite is a permitted additive to Portland cements often up to a 5 wt.% limit. It is shown by experiment and calculation that much if not all of this calcite is reactive and affects the distribution of lime alumina and sulfate and thereby alters the mineralogy of hydrated cement pastes.

Limestone is also the main constituent of cement and concrete. In cement making. Cement is made by first mixing limestone and substances such as clays (which contain silica alumina and iron(III) oxide) to a fine powder. The mixture is crushed and fed into a rotary kiln which is an iron pipe 60-90 m long and approximately 6 m in diameter.
