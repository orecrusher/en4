## Iron and Steel Industry 
 · Iron and steel integrated producers (ore-based) are typically large firms that operate ore and coal mines (frequently as joint ventures) as well as iron and steelmaking plants. Producers include such companies as Essar Steel Algoma (formerly Algoma Steel ) of Sault Ste. Marie Ontario Dofasco of Hamilton Ontario and ArcelorMittal Montréal (formerly Sidbec-Dosco ).

## Making steel 
Steel is made from iron ore a compound of iron oxygen and other minerals that occurs in nature. The raw materials for steelmaking are mined and then transformed into steel using two different processes: the blast furnace/basic oxygen furnace route and the electric arc furnace route.

## Iron ore mining process and iron ore mining equipments
Mining and processing of iron ore involves coarse crushing and screening. Iron ore is beneficiated by crushing and then separating the iron from the gangue minerals through screening. This is usually so efficient that lower grade ore can be treated especially when the magnetite is quite coarse.

## Iron Ore Mining 
MINING AND PROCESSING: Iron ore mining can be broadly divided into two egories namely 1) manual mining which is employed in small mines and 2) mechanized mining is suitable for large iron ore mines. Manual mining method is normally limited to float ores and small mines. Mining of reef ore is also being done manually on a small scale.

After identifying the underlying mines engineers extract the iron ore and prepare it to de-compose the impurities and obtain the pure metal. The refined iron is very vulnerable to oxidation. In fact in order to be suitable for the use in solid metal structures in various industries it must be initially alloyed with other elements which are generally carbon nickel and chromium.

The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however because iron does not occur naturally it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.

## 5. The technology of mining and metallurgy
Iron metallurgy is also based on the reduction of the ore to obtain pig iron which has a much higher metal content. The pig iron is then processed in a converter in order to obtain steel - unlike alumina and copper blister which are electrolytically refined. Processing the ore into pig iron takes place in a blast furnace; this type of furnace

The first metallurgical step involved in this process is to reduce iron ore to metallic iron in a blast furnace using coke as both a fuel and reducing agent. The produced metallic iron contains a relatively high proportion of carbon (4%) and it is passed to the steelmaking process in the form of liquid at approximately 1450 C called as 'hot metal'.
