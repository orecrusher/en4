## New Design Procedure for Stability of Soft Clays 
A new method of selecting design shear strengths for soft clay foundations is presented which avoids much of the empiricism of the present methods. Current design practice is analyzed in light of the results of recent research into the behavior of soft clays.

In the stiff-mud process or extrusion process the clay is mixed with just enough water to produce clay plastic mass with water in the range of 10 to 15 percent of the clay mass. Next the clay is extruded through a "die" producing a horizontal column of clay which passes by conveyor belt through an automatic wire cutter to create the individual brick.

This Bottom Feed process requires a smaller grade of stone (2-45mm). By remaining in the ground during column construction the poker cases its own hole and hence is suited to ground with a high water table or running sand conditions. Wet top feed process is called vibro-replacement and dry top/bottom feed process is called vibro displacement: VI.

## [PDF] Embankment over Soft Clay – Design and Construction 
The construction of embankment (including reclamation with hydraulic fills) over very soft compressible alluvial deposits (e.g. Clay silty Clay clayey Silt etc.) is increasing due to lack of suitable land for infrastructures and other developments. The choice of construction method in this formation is not only governed by direct costs but also the long term maintenance costs duration of

## Compaction 
Compaction is a process that brings about an increase in soil density or unit weight accompanied by a decrease in air volume.There is usually no change in water content.The degree of compaction is measured by dry unit weight and depends on the water content and compactive effort (weight of hammer number of impacts weight of roller number of passes).

• Polymerbased modelling clay is equally soft and can be baked in a oven to fix a composition. It can be prone to cracking though. • Pottery or 'firing' clay – a water-based clay which can be shaped and fired at temperatures in excess of 121°C to stay firm.

## What Are the Stages of Clay? 
 · Clay is in the bisque or bisqueware stage after it has been fired in a kiln once. It is still porous but cannot become soft again if water is added to it. No additional clay pieces are able to be added to the design after it's been fired once. The firing of the kiln fully hardens the clay and this is the time when the sculpture can be glazed.
