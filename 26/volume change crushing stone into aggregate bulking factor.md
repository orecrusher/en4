Bulking of sand is an important volumetric change that takes place in the sand when they are moist. Sand increase in volume to the extent of 20-30 percent when they contain moisture between 2-8 percent. This is because moisture in small proportions forms thin films around the sand grains. Fine sands bulk greater than coarse sand.

Aggregates consist of fine aggregates and coarse aggregates. Generally aggregate less than 4.75 mm is classified as fine aggregate. The popular and most preferred materials used as fine aggregates are river sand and crushed stones. However river sand and crushed stone are produced at great cost and at the expense of

## The Complete Guide to Crushed Stone and Gravel 
 · Unlike crushed stone gravel is usually sold and used in its natural state. If it is crushed gravel loses its unique smooth rounded texture and becomes crushed stone. It is important to note that some contractors refer to any stone in certain size ranges as "gravel" even if it is crushed stone.

 · Aggregates generally occupy 70 to 80% of concrete volume ⇒They are expected to have an important influence on its properties. Physical thermal chemical properties of aggregate influence the performance of concrete Aggregates are derived for the most part from natural rocks (crushed stone or natural gravels) and sands.
