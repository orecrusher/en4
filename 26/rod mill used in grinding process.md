The characteristic of the rod Mill is that in the grinding process the grinding medium is in line contact with the ore so it has a certain selective grinding effect. Product particle size is more uniform less crushing ore grains. When used in coarse grinding the processing capacity of the rod mill is larger than that of the ball mill.
