## Ball Mills 
3.6.1.1 Ball Milling. A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind and blend bulk material into QDs /nanosize using different sized balls. The working principle is simple; impact and attrition size reduction take place as the ball drops from near the top of a rotating hollow cylindrical shell.

Ball Mills are generally used to grind material 1/4 inch and finer down to the particle size of 20 to 75 microns. To achieve a reasonable efficiency with ball mills they must be operated in a closed system with oversize material continuously being recirculated back into the mill to be reduced.

Milling cutters with keyed holes are predominantly for use in horizontal mills. End mills are designed for cutting slots keyways and pockets. Two fluted end mills can be used to plunge into work like a drill. End mills with more than two flutes should not be plunged into the work. Ball end mills can produce a fillet.

## How Do Ball Valves Work? 
 · A ball valve as its name neatly suggests is any valve that utilizes a ball to control the flow of substances from one opening to the next.The center of the ball includes a port sometimes called a bore. The ball valve is in the open position when this central port is aligned up in the same direction as the connected pipeline as such a positioning allows the fluid or gas to flow through.

 · SAG mill make use of steel balls included with some large and hard rocks for grinding. These mills utilize the balls in making the large fragments of materials broken into pieces. The ball charge of a SAG mill is about 9% to 20%.This process takes place inside the large rotating drum of SAG mill which is filled with balls partially.
