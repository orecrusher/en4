Silica sand is commonly used for abrasive blasting where reclaiming is not feasible such as in unconfined abrasive blasting operations. Sand has a rather high breakdown rate which can result in substantial dust generation. Worker exposure to free crystalline silica is of concern when silica sand is used for abrasive blasting.

 · Keep your green sand temperature below 120F ( 49°C ) from the mixer to the molding machine. In other words your correlation between green sand properties will greatly suffer with high and variable sand temperature. Of course this requires you invest in a sand temperature control system which will cool your sand because it's too hot.
