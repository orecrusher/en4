## What Are the Different Types of Mining Machines?
Open-pit mining is a technique commonly used to mine copper. Open-pit mining uses large holes in the ground that are excavated to the depth of the desired product and are common for sand gravel and copper mines. Mining machines called draglines use a moving bucket to scrape away the soil lying over the ore deposit.

## Causes Effects and Solutions for Mining 
For mining purposes big machines are often used in order to make the mining process more effective and to reduce the physical work for miners. However these machines emit large amounts of harmful gases also including greenhouse gases like methane or CO2. Thus mining can also cause air pollution and the implied consequences.
