## The Hoek–Brown failure criterion and GSI – 2018 edition 
 · The Hoek–Brown criterion was introduced in 1980 to provide input for the design of underground excavations in rock. The criterion now incorporates both intact rock and discontinuities such as joints characterized by the geological strength index (GSI) into a system designed to estimate the mechanical behaviour of typical rock masses encountered in tunnels slopes and foundations.

Uranium was originally found as a bi- product of Radium and Vanadium mining. As the need for uranium increased uranium specific mines were opened. However these mines became more and more expensive as shallow high grade deposits became depleted and the cost of mining equipment transportation and regulations increased.

Hardrock mining exposes rock that has lain unexposed for geological eras. When crushed these rocks expose radioactive elements asbestos-like minerals and metallic dust. During separation residual rock slurries which are mixtures of pulverized rock and liquid are produced as tailings toxic and radioactive elements from these liquids can leak into bedrock if not properly contained.
