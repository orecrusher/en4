## Manufacturing process of grinding media balls
 · Method of balls rolling on ball- rolling mills is one of the most modern production methods. Transversal rolling of balls from the round billet is economical. It differs from other methods due to the possibility to produce grinding balls on the uninterrupted automated aggregates which allows 2 to 8 times to increase the output and 10-15% to reduce the consumption of metal.

Ball size distribution is governed by the wear law of the mill and by the wear characteristics through the cross-section of the balls charged to the mill. With this in mind it is interesting to make a qualitative comparison of the ball size distributions which should be generated by 76 mm pearlitic carbon steel balls versus 76 mm martensitic alloy steel balls in the 2.93 m mills.
