## Jaw Crusher 
For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80–85% of the gape. Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7 the width should be = 45.7 × 1.7 = 78 cm.

## Understanding the Different Types of Crushers 
Jaw crushers are routinely choke fed to maximize production capacity and ensure that particles are uniformly broken. This promotes stone-on-stone crushing which breaks up flaky or slabbier particles. Those seeking fewer fines should try trickle feeding material into the jaw crusher.

A jaw crusher should not be sized to the maximum size rock that might be fed to the plant but a size that will handle 95-98% of the material that might be fed to the jaw. Buying to the maximum size of rock that might be fed the jaw will result in buying a jaw crusher that will be under-utilized difficult to keep choke-fed cost more than necessary and have a much higher operating cost.
