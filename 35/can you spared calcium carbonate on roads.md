## Calcium Chloride – The Essential Element for Better Roads 
Calcium chloride works best when applied just before roads become dry and dusty because it can then retain moisture already present in the road. Apply calcium chloride immediately after spring shaping before the road has dried from the spring rains. Although liquid calcium chloride makes unpaved roads hard it can make paved roads slick.

## Synthesis of precipitated calcium carbonate: a review 
 · Calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) is widely found in almost all living creatures as well in some human tissues.Compared with other inorganic materials over the years CaCO 3 has shown auspicious potential for the development of smart carriers for various anti-malignant neoplastic drugs. It is biodegradable biocompatible and also a good pH-sensitive material.
