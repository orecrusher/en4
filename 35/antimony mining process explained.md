## Antimony 
Antimony is a member of group 15 of the periodic table one of the elements called pnictogens and has an electronegativity of 2.05. In accordance with periodic trends it is more electronegative than tin or bismuth and less electronegative than tellurium or arsenic.Antimony is stable in air at room temperature but reacts with oxygen if heated to produce antimony trioxide Sb 2 O 3.
