explanation. "Run-of-mine" ore is a mix of valuable minerals and worthless rock in which each ingredient is priced separately. Run- of-mine ore is treated in the dressing plant and processed into different concentrates. Where the ore contains more than one metal of value separate concentrates of for example copper zinc and lead are produced.
