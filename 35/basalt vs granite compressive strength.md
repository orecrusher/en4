## Can We Truly Predict the Compressive Strength of Concrete 
(e.g. limestone basalt sandstone granite). For example basalt can be considered to be a high-quality aggregate due to its high density and high mechanical strength but its bond with the cement paste may be not strong enough due to its very smooth texture which is relatively similar to that of glass [11].

## Study On the Compressive and Split Tensile Strength 
Compression test Compression strength of concrete with and without basalt was conducted. The compression test was conducted as per IS 516 – 1959. The specimens were kept in water for curing for 7 days 14 days and 28 days and on removal were tested in dry condition and grit present on the surface. The load was applied without shock

## Difference Between Basalt and Granite 
 · Summary – Basalt vs Granite. Basalt and granite are two types of igneous rocks that we can find on earth. The key difference between basalt and granite is that basalt is mostly occurring on ocean floors while granite is in the crust of the earth in all continents. Reference: 1. "Basalt." Wikipedia Wikimedia Foundation 13 Sept. 2018.

## Brittle strength of basaltic rock masses with appliions 
 · Values of tensile and cohesive strength for the basaltic rock mass are approximately one to two orders of magnitude lower than corresponding values for intact basalt. Temperatures comparable to those at the Venus surface may slightly increase the deformation modulus but decrease the compressive strength of the rock mass.
