## Re: Cement Shelf life 
Re: Cement Shelf life. Dear Ted GhulamThank you for your technical support related to the subject. I need one more help. 1. Is there any problem to add limestone with cement intergrinding ( up to 5 % in OPC)? 2. What is the factor can influence the cement production up to 10 %. 3.

## Explained: Cement vs. concrete — their differences and 
 · Cement production begins with limestone a sedimentary rock. Once quarried it is mixed with a silica source such as industrial byproducts slag or fly ash and gets fired in a kiln at 2700 degrees Fahrenheit. What comes out of the kiln is called clinker. Cement plants grind clinker down to an extremely fine powder and mix in a few additives.

 · Cement is the substance which holds concrete together which means that it is extremely widely used in our society. It has been manufactured in New Zealand for more than 100 years and during this century production has increased one hundred-fold. Portland cement (the only type of cement in common use today) is manufactured in a four step process.

## Cement Production 
Cement production is one of the largest industries in the world. Annual world production in 2013 was approximately 4 GT (of which about half was in China). It is produced in kilns at around 1400o C (2500 o F) and approximately 750 kg (1650 lb) of CO 2 are released for each tonne (2205 lb.) that is made.

Lime Component Limestone: Common forms of calcium carbonate used as raw material for cement manufacturing are limestone and chalk.Limestone is of predominantly fine grained crystalline structure its hardness is between 1.8 to 3.0 of the Mohs scale of hardness and specific gravity 2. To 2.8. Limestone usually contains admixtures of clay substance or iron compounds which influences its color.

The Tunstead site is home to one of the largest limestone quarries in Europe producing over six million tonnes of stone a year. The process is highly efficient as the extraction of limestone production of lime and cement are all intrinsically linked and over 99% of quarried material is converted into saleable products and the remainder is used on site for restoration purposes.

The main raw material used in cement production has traditionally been limestone. Limestone is abundantly available but over 60% of the industry's CO 2 emissions are caused by transformation of limestone into lime called "decarbonation". Accordingly part of the route towards a low carbon concrete-built environment can involve limestone substitution.
