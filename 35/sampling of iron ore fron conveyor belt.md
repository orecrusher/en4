Rule 10: All cutters for belt sizes 900 mm and larger must be counterweighted. This avoids potential structural problems with the conveyor belt. Rule 11: All material delimited by the cutter and none other must be included in the sample. Rule 12: No material shall remain in the cutter after the cutter has collected and discharged an increment.
