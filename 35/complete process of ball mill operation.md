Energy consumption and output. Cement mills are normally driven by electric motors. Modern installations draw power of 2-10 MW. The power (in kW) required to turn a ball mill is approximated by: P = 0.285 d (1.073-j) m n where d is the internal diameter in metres j is the fraction of the mill volume occupied by media m is the total mass of media in the mill in tonnes and n is the mill
