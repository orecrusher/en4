## Materials 
Materials - Sintered Division. Sustainability and resource conservation begins with our raw material feedstock – typically recycled metal reclaimed from stamping and other metal-working technologies. These materials are melted and powder is produced through a process known as "water atomization".

## Sintering in the Powder Metallurgy Process
At sintering temperature the copper melts and then diffuses into the iron powder particles creating swelling. By careful selection of copper content it is possible to balance this swelling against the natural shrinkage of the iron powder skeleton and provide a material that does not change in dimensions at all during sintering.

 · The iron electrode in this study was prepared by sintering of carbonyl iron onto nickel mesh in an inert atmosphere. The iron electrode was then subjected to repeated charge-discharge cycling in 30% w/v KOH electrolyte in a three-electrode configuration with two sintered nickel-oxide counter electrodes and a mercury/mercuric oxide reference electrode.

Sinter is created by mixing iron ore concentrate with several additives such as limestone and silica to control the chemistry and then igniting it at 1200°C in a continuous belt-fed furnace. Sinter feed composition control is important because the various sinter feed materials are not perfectly characterized and their chemical makeup varies within a batch and between batches.
