## Green Sand: An Introduction to Its Use in Foundries 
Green sand is a compound mixture used for casting of metals in foundry appliions as a mould. It is 'green' not by colour but takes the moniker due to the fact that it is not 'set' when the metal is poured into it rather it is still in the 'green

## What are Green Sand Castings? 
Green Sand Castings are castings made using wet sand or "green sand" molds. The sand is not green in color nor do the molds use "greensand" a greenish color sandstone. Instead the sand is called "green" because it has moisture in it before the sand dries out for casting. Learn more!

## How Are Green Sand Moulds Made? 
 · The disadvantage of green sand moulds for castings is that their tolerance is not as tight as some other mould types such as 'no bake castings'. By this if you have castings that need accurate dimensions or tight tolerance you may go for green sand castings as they require a tad more machining compared to other types of moulds to achieve the intended result.

## What is foundry sand? 
 · The sand temperature can be influenced by variations in the way foundries dry and cool their reclaimed green sand or store and distribute their no bake sand. As foundry sand is an integral part of the casting process using sand that is too hot or too cold leads to reduced casting quality with lasting negative affects along the entire production line.
