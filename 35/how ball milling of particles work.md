wet ball mill work surface. Ball milling. In fact if mica or other flat particles exist it may be practically impossible to grind them to minus 200 for this reason ball milling is normally done in consort with wet screening and/or roller-milling/air floating for example so that large particles have already been removed by the time the material reaches the ball mill

## Fluidized Energy Mill: Operating principles subclasses 
 · Fluidized Energy mill also known as micronizer or jet mill is a type of mill that consists of a hollow toroid that has a diameter of 20-200 mm depending on the height of the loop which can be up to 2 m. It operates by particle impaction and attrition. A fluid or milling gas usually air or inert gas is injected as a high-pressure jet through

 · For hard materials such as ceramics carbides and hard metals attrition mills are more efficient than conventional tumbler and vibratory ball mills. The main advantages of attrition mills for mixing and blending tungsten carbide/cobalt cutting tool powders include short milling time production of fine particle size (submicron sized) and enhanced smearing of cobalt onto carbide particles.

Small balls give more point contacts but larger balls give greater impact. As with all grinding mills working surfaces gradually wear so product contamination must be guarded against. At low speeds of rotation the balls are not lifted very far up the walls of the cylinder. The balls tumble over each other and shear forces predominate.
