## LARCO GMMSA 
Ferronickel is primarily used in the manufacture of Austenitic stainless steels (known as 200 and 300 series). These are non-magnetic and contain between 8.5%-25% nickel enhancing their corrosion resistance. They are the most widely used group of stainless steels accounting for between 70%-75% of global stainless output.
