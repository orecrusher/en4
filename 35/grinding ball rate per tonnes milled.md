## Ball Mills 
8.3.2.2 Ball mills. The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media. The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1–1.5 times the shell diameter ( Figure 8.11). The feed can be dry with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating or slurry containing 20–40% water by weight.

## How to Reduce Steel Consumption in Grinding Mills
 · The overall wear of the steel in the grinding mills occurs as a peeling of the steel surfaces at a constant radial rate per unit time. This concept although challenged at times was first introduced by Prentice in evaluating the wear of grinding balls and subsequently demonstrated on large ball mills.
