## Mapping Oil Pressure to Measure Bearing Wear
 · Antifriction (roller or ball-type) bearings can normally run on relatively small volumes of oil. However a drop-off in oil volume will cause wear on the cage due to the increased sliding contact in this area. The wear then allows the rollers or balls to move out of position and accelerate wear of the bearing races. Oil Mapping

## What are roller chain wear indiors? 
 · A simple and effective way to measure chain wear is using a chain-wear indior. Basically this is a kind of tool that measures wear in the chain as a function of a gap space between two rollers. The way you use it is to insert the tool (the chain wear indior or gauge) in the space between two rollers.
