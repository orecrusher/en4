## Ore Beneficiation 
Ubiquitous microorganisms inhabiting iron ore deposits are useful in iron ore beneficiation (e.g. removal of alkalis silica clays phosphorous and alumina). Because the presence of phosphorous in the iron ore promotes bacterial growth (as an energy source) iron oxide particles having higher phosphorous contents were seen to be colonized by different bacterial cells.
