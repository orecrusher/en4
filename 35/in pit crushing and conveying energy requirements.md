 · In-pit crushing and conveying (IPCC) is being increasingly considered as an alternative to traditional truck-shovel mining methods. The move towards IPCC is driven by a number of factors including the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions the availability of skilled labour and the need to increase extraction rates to levels that present significant challenges to traditional methods.
