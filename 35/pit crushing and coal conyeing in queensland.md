## Prevention 
Prevention. Where mine lung disease (MDLD) is concerned prevention is by far the best medicine. This is why ensuring that every Queensland mine and quarry worker is protected from exposure to harmful levels of respirable dust is the most crucial action we can take to prevent mine dust lung disease.

 · Raw coal from the opencast and from the highwall mining operation is transported 16km by an overland belt conveyor to the preparation plant area. Here crushing in three 2000tph rotary breakers is followed by transfer of the crushed coal to the prep plant itself where a multi-circuit (dense medium spirals and flotation) washing system is used to give coarse medium and fine coal products.

 · Pit re-design: Unless you are using EPCC your pit will need some redesign to accommodate the crusher pocket and conveying route. The conveyor may have a dedied route or be placed alongside an existing (but widened) haul route. Where possible the conveyor route should be as straight as possible to minimise transfer points.

In suitable mining projects in-pit crushing and conveying (IPCC) can provide operating cost reductions to the tune of 20 - 60% savings depending on project specifics. For this reason IPCC systems have been in use around the world for decades. IPCC systems consist of a primary crusher installed in-pit close to the active mining areas.

## New Focus on In
The semi-mobile in-pit crusher will deliver product to this stockpile via a new 3.5- km underground conveyor system. The two new crushers are designed to treat ROM up to 1200 x 1200 x 1200 mm with an ore density of 2.8 mt/m3 and a bulk density of 1.8 mt/m3. The maximum size of the crushed product will be 300 x 300 x 600 mm.

## In Pit Crushing and Conveying (IPCC) Systems
Rio Tinto Clermont Mine in Central Queensland uses an In-Pit Crushing and Conveying System (IPCC) for a major component of its overburden stripping for the mine. The IPCC consists of a fully mobile sizing rig operating in the upper levels of the pit combined with a ramp conveyor 2.5km movable pivoting dump conveyor and a tripper/stacker on the dump.

## Ultimate pit limit determination for semi mobile in
 · Semi mobile in-pit crushing and conveying systems have different pit shape requirements to traditional truck haulage systems due to the inclusion of a conveyor flight in the pit. As the shape of a pit is heavily influenced by the ultimate pit limit it is desirable to have the additional shape requirements included in the ultimate pit limit determination process.
