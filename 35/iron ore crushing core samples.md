Iron processing Ores Britannica. Crushing. As-mined iron ore contains lumps of varying size the biggest being more than 1 metre (40 inches) across and the smallest about 1 millimetre (0.04 inch). The blast furnace however requires lumps between 7 and 25 millimetres so the ore must be crushed to reduce the maximum particle size.

## THE BASICS OF LOGGING CORE FOR EXPLORATION
Core boxes for NQ core are built to hole 15 feet – the typical length of a core barrel. We like to measure things in meters so 15 feet of core = 4.57 meters. So each core box holds approximately 4.5 meters of core. Now when the drillers tag the meterage they are doing so by sight – mistakes do happen.
