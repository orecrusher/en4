A process for the beneficiation of Manganese ore which includes the step of leaching of the ore with acid to remove Calcium Carbonate and Magnesium Carbonate. The ore is first broken down to the required particle size by conventional means. Selective leaching of Calcium oxide and Magnesium carbonate occurs leaving an ore having a higher Manganese content.
