Conversion — Iron- and carbon-rich fines dust and wet sludge converted to high-quality feedstock. Mixing — Connects fine carbon particles to iron oxides for improved reduction. Binder — Less binder for more high-value metallics and carbon recovery. Sizing — Our dies ensure precise sizing from 10-150mm for most smelting processes.
