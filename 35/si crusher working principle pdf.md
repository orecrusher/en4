## Two Stroke Engine: Main Parts Principle Working 
 · Two stroke engines have two types. First one is known as Spark ignition engine or better known as petrol engine which works on Otto Cycle and other one is compression ignition engine or diesel engine which works on diesel cycle. Both these engines works on same principle with some fundamental differences. Its working can be summarized as follow.

## Impact Crusher 
A jaw crusher crushes only a small proportion of the original aggregate particles but an impact crusher crushes mortar and aggregate particles alike and thus generates a higher amount of fine material (O'Mahony 1990). Gyratory crushers work on the same principle as cone crushers (Figure 4.4(c)).
