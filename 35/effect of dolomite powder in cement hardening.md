If the cement has already more moisture in it then the value of water-cement ratio will actually affect the workability and strength rather than increasing it. If the specific gravity of cement is greater than 3.19 then the cement is either not minced finely as per the industry standard or it has more moisture content which will affect the mix and bonding.
