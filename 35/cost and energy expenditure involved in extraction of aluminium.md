 · Because it is so reactive aluminium cannot be extracted economically using chemical processes; instead it is extracted by electrolysis in the Hall-Héroult process. A bank of Hall-Héroult cells The Hall-Héroult process uses a huge amount of electricity; hundreds of thousands of amperes are used in each cell and a single plant may contain hundreds of cells connected in series.

Extraction of Metals. Aluminium - Cost and Recycling.. Aluminium is the third most abundant element in the Earth's crust after oxygen and silicon. It is the most abundant metal but it is more expensive to produce than iron because of the cost of the large amounts of electricity which are needed for electrolysis - see moles. About half of the aluminium used in the UK is recycled.

Extraction of Metals. Extraction of Aluminium - Electrolysis Cell.. The steel container is coated with carbon and this is used as the negative electrode ().. Aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3) is an ionic compound. When it is melted the Al 3+ and O 2-ions are free to move and conduct electricity. Electrolysis of the alumina/cryolite solution gives aluminium at the hode and oxygen at the anode.

## Mining and Refining – Energy Efficiency 
Aluminium is an "energy bank"; most of the original input can be recovered every time the product is recycled. Bauxite mining requires relatively low energy inputs compared to other steps in the aluminium production process – with less than 1.5 kilograms of fuel oil (mainly in the form of diesel for haul trucks) and less than 5 kWh of electricity consumed per tonne of bauxite extracted.

The cost of picking up and transporting recyclables can range from $20 to $70 per ton depending on the length and difficulty of the recycling truck routes and the budget also has to consider the energy cost of the fossil fuels burned to run these trucks as well as labor and fuel costs to sort process and market the recycled material.
