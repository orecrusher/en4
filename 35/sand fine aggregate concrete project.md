## What Is Fine Aggregate 
 · Fine aggregates are essentially any natural sand particles won from the land through the mining process. Fine aggregates consist of natural sand or any crushed stone particles that are ¼" or smaller.This product is often referred to as 1/4'" minus as it refers to the size or grading of this particular aggregate.

Key points. • 'Aggregate' is a term for any particulate material. It includes gravel crushed stone sand slag recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates. Aggregate may be natural manufactured or recycled. • Aggregates make up some 60 -80% of the concrete mix. They provide compressive strength and bulk to concrete.

## EXPERIMENTAL STUDY ON CONCRETE USING SEA SAND 
 · Abstract: Concrete is the most popular building material in the world. River sand has been the most popular choice for the fine aggregate component of concrete in the past but overuse of the material has led to environmental concerns the depleting of securable river sand deposits and a concomitant price increase in the material. Therefore it is desirable to obtain cheap environmentally friendly substitutes for river sand that is preferably sea sand. The Land Reclamation and Development Board (Sri Lanka) plans to popularize the use of sea sand as an alternative to river sand. According to the experts in the global construction trade Sea Sand is being used in the construction industry in the Asian Region and some leading European countries. Civil Engineering Department of University of Moratuwa (Sri Lanka) and the National Building Research Organization [NBRO] (Sri Lanka) have confirmed that the sea sand pumped from a distance of about ten kilometers is very suitable for building construction industry. This study is to experiment the suitability to use beach/sea sand as a substitute for river sand

Sand is a common example of a fine aggregate in concrete. In order for aggregate to be effective it must be strong. Weak aggregate materials will weaken the resulting concrete which is not desirable. Aggregate must also be hard so that it keeps its shape without deforming in the concrete.

## Fine Aggregate: Definition Size Density and Properties 
Fine aggregate is the essential ingredient in concrete that consists of natural sand or crushed stone. The quality and fine aggregate density strongly influence the hardened properties of the concrete.. The concrete or mortar mixture can be made more durable stronger and cheaper if you made the selection of fine aggregate

## Suitability Of Beach Sand As Fine Aggregate For Concrete
 · This Suitability Of Beach Sand As Fine Aggregate For Concrete paper presents as partial and complete replacement of fine aggregates the design of concrete mixes made with sea sand. Concrete is the world's most widely used man-made product and is second only to water as the most widely used substance in the world. Because of the large amount of production it is important to define the impact of concrete on global ecology. This means that in addition to 15 billion tons of cement the concrete industry consumes 9 billion tons of sand
