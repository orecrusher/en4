 · 4.Gold Tailings Enrichment. Gold mines often contain a lot of valuable associated minerals such as iron silver and copper. When processing gold ore it is necessary to not only improve the grade of gold rock but also comprehensively recycle other by-products. However sometimes the gold ore tailings still contain a relatively low amount of

## Tailings 
Tailings are the materials left over after the process of separating the valuable fraction from the uneconomic fraction of an ore.Tailings are distinct from overburden which is the waste rock or other material that overlies an ore or mineral body and is displaced during mining without being processed.. The extraction of minerals from ore can be done two ways: placer mining which uses water

The word tailings is sometimes applied to include coarse mine waste. For this website the term tailings refers to the slurry waste output from the processing plant. The properties of tailings are dependent on the ore body being mined the grinding and processing circuits the reagent properties and the thickening process prior to disposal.

## Tailingsfo What Are Tailings? 
Tailings consist of ground rock and process effluents that are generated in a mine processing plant. Mechanical and chemical processes are used to extract the desired product from the run of the mine ore and produce a waste stream known as tailings. This process of product extraction is never 100% efficient nor is it possible to reclaim all

## How to Extract Gold from Tailing?
 · 2. Gold Extraction Method From Silie Inclusions. When the gold distribution rate in the tailings in the form of silie (quartz) coating is high the method of destroying silie inclusions can be used to extract gold. It mainly includes two methods: alkali leaching desiliion and low temperature caustic soda roasting-water leaching.

as pyrites. In a typical pyrytic gold ore the gold is encapsulated within an iron sulfide crystal structure. Highly oxidized ores generally do not respond well to flotation. Advantages of the flotation process are that gold values are generally liberated at a fairly coarse particle size (28 mesh) which means that ore grinding costs are minimized.

 · The annual output of heavy placer gold in the gold ore dressing plant accounts for about 25% of the annual gold output. When the coarse-grained gold enters the leaching system the process flow cannot be satisfied due to the long leaching time required which further affects the tailings and tailing liquid indiors.
