## Mining 
Smarter steels depend on high-quality raw materials. As one of the world's leading producers of iron ore we supply nearly half of our own iron ore needs and provide the types of coal that are essential to steelmaking. Our mining assets provide supply security and quality for our own operations and a source of high-value raw materials for our customers.
