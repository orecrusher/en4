## Iron Processing 
Our robust pug mills (paddle mixers) and rotary dryers are also frequently relied upon for processing steel by-products in the form of dust and scale in order to liberate iron ore. Rotary dryers may also be used in ore drying appliions. We can also supply briquetters for briquetting sponge iron and hot briquetted iron (HBI).

## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth? 
 · Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining. The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however because iron does not occur naturally it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.

Your suggestion is highly relevant. Tailings are variable by essence with mining and processing. For instance early Pb-Zn tailings are generally pyrite-poor as pyrite was valorized for sulphur. Since a few decades pyrite is dumped in tailings changing radically their composition (and AMD behavior). We should talk of tailings stratigraphy here.
