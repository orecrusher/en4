## Cone Crusher 
Cone crushers were originally designed and developed by around 1920 and therefore are often described as cone crushers. As the mechanisms of crushing in these crushers are similar to gyratory crushers their designs are similar but in this case the spindle is supported at the bottom of the gyrating cone instead of being suspended as in larger gyratory crushers.
