## Mineral Processing 
Mineral processing mineral beneficiation or upgradation involves handling three primary types of ROM material which have been blasted fragmented and brought out from an in situ position. These materials can be used directly or by simple or complex processing and even by applying extractive metallurgy like hydrometallurgical or pyrometallurgical methods.

## Introduction to Mineral Processing or Beneficiation
 · In broader terms mineral processing consists of two functions. Firstly it involves the preparation and liberation of the valuable minerals from waste minerals and secondly the separation these values into two or more products called concentrates. The term separation in this case is synonymous with concentration.

Mineral Separation Processing. Following wet processing the heavy mineral concentrate undergoes a number of dry processing stages to separate the valuable minerals and produce saleable products.. Dry mill processing relies upon the unique physical properties of each mineral to separate the non-valuable minerals from the valuable heavy minerals.

## Spiral Concentrator 
Spiral separation uses a flowing film principle based on the size and specific gravity difference present in a mineral suite. When fed a dilute pulp mixture of minerals of different specific gravities the lighter minerals are more readily suspended by the water and attain relatively high tangential velocities so that they climb toward the outer rim of the spiral trough.
