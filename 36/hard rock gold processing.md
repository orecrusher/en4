## How to Test a Rock for Gold 
 · Take a rock that contains gold in it – this process works best on quartz rocks – and set it inside a glass jar. Add white cooking vinegar to the jar covering the entire rock and then some with the vinegar. The acid-based vinegar slowly dissolves the quartz crystals surrounding the gold leaving only bits of quartz attached to the gold.

 · The gold cyanide complex is then extracted from the pulp or slurry by adsorption onto activated carbon. CIL stands for carbon-in-leach. This is a gold extraction process called cyanidation where carbon is added to the leach tanks (or reaction vessel) so that leaching and adsorption take place in the same tanks.

 · In mineral processing or metallurgy the first stage of comminution is crushing.. Depending of the type of rock (geometallurgy) to be crushed there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks. In principle compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear-resistant plate/surface.

 · Gold deposits like these are highly valuable to mining companies as they can sell not only the gold ore but the other rare minerals as well. This is called lode mining when gold and other elements are extracted as hard rock. Secondary gold actually comes from primary gold and is often found in streams rivers waterways and creek beds.

Removing the gold-bearing rock from the ground is just the first step. To isolate pure gold mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel.

## Assaying Ores to determine gold content
When you are doing anything with hard rock materials sampling and assaying are the key concepts. Before any material is taken to be assayed but it still is the best method for determining the quantity of gold in a rock matrix. The fire assay process works by fusing or dissolving the rock sample in a crucible using a lead glass flux.
