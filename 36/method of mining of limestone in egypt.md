This method was termed by Stocks (1993) as the Twist-Reverse-Twist Drilling (TRTD) method. The experiment in vessel making starts with the shaping of a block of limestone with copper chisels and adzes flint chisels punches scrapers and rubbers made of sandstone. The rough shaping of the vase took about 6.5 hours.
