## PCB Manufacture: How are PCBs Made » Electronics Notes
The manufacture of multi-layer printed circuit boards although it uses the same processes as for single layer boards requires a considerably greater degree of accuracy and manufacturing process control. The boards are made by using much thinner individual boards one for each layer and these are then bonded together to produce the overall PCB.
