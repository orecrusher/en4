## Iron: Uses of Iron 
We all know iron is one such metallic element which has innumerable uses. Chemically it is represented by the chemical symbol of Fe and is egorized as a transition element in the periodic table.Iron is rarely found in its pure form on the surface of the earth; as it tends to get oxidized when it comes in contact with atmospheric oxygen.

The first metallurgical step involved in this process is to reduce iron ore to metallic iron in a blast furnace using coke as both a fuel and reducing agent. The produced metallic iron contains a relatively high proportion of carbon (4%) and it is passed to the steelmaking process in the form of liquid at approximately 1450 C called as 'hot metal'.
