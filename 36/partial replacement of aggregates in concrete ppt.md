coarse aggregate partially in the percentage of 10% 20% 30% 40% 50%. The replaced concrete is compared with the normal concrete. For this cube samples of size 150mm150mm150mm are casted for each percentage of replaced concrete and normal concrete. The cubes are prepared in the proportions of 1:1.4:2.2 and the water cement ratio of 0.45.
