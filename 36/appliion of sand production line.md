Sand casting also known as sand molded casting is a metal casting process characterized by using sand as the mold material. The term "sand casting" can also refer to an object produced via the sand casting process. Sand castings are produced in specialized factories called foundries.Over 60% of all metal castings are produced via sand casting process.

Sand-lime bricks are made out of sand lime and water (no additives). By high pressing the mixture and autoclaving afterwards a firm white building material is produced. Good acoustic insulation good heat humidity accumulation as well as excellent fire resistance are the main parameters for architects to prescribe lime sand bricks for each building project.
