Uses. The primary use of ammonium sulfate is as a fertilizer for alkaline soils.In the soil the ammonium ion is released and forms a small amount of acid lowering the pH balance of the soil while contributing essential nitrogen for plant growth. The main disadvantage to the use of ammonium sulfate is its low nitrogen content relative to ammonium nitrate which elevates transportation costs.
