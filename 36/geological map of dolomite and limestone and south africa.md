Dolomite also known as "dolostone" and "dolomite rock" is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of the mineral dolomite CaMg (CO 3) 2. Dolomite is found in sedimentary basins worldwide. It is thought to form by the postdepositional alteration of lime mud and limestone by magnesium-rich groundwater. Dolomite and limestone are very similar rocks.
