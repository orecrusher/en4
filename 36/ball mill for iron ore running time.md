## The Steel Manufacturing Process 
 · Steel is a discovery of the Iron Age a period that started around 1200 BCE. Iron ore was first mined in Central Asia and Europe and humans at this time used iron to make tools and weapons in a practice called ferrous metallurgy. Iron products evolved during this time beginning with blacksmiths producing wrought iron goods.

In iron ore for instance a variation of 2 to 3% solid content in the slurry could lead to a difference up to 10% on the energy (kWh/T) for a similar grind.

The development of cyanide milling at the end of the nineteenth century required grinding into smaller and more uniform sized particles using Chilean mills ball mills and tube mills. After crushing or grinding miners often used vibrating or shaking machines called concentrators (e.g. jigs buddles vanners Embrey tables and tables) to separate heavier metal-bearing ores from gangue.

To maximize the capacity of these circuits the general practice is to use grates with pebble ports (reaching 100 mm) instead of normal grate openings to increase the pebble removal.

The true Iron Age started however when people figured out how to extract useful iron from ores and that requires melting to soft taffy-like near-liquid or liquid states. This advance came to different parts of the globe at different times but involved the invention of bloomery furnaces and a slow building of the knowledge of ferrous metallurgy.

## Operation Principle of Iron Ore Ball Mill 
 · Iron ore grinding is completed in the ball mill so the Iron ore ball mill is the main place for ore materials. Just like other ball mills the Iron ore ball mill is mainly composed by a feeding part an exhaust end a rotation and transmission part(a reduction box an electrical machine an electronic control and pinion drive gear) and other parts.

## Smithing cannonballs 
After completion of Dwarf Cannon players can smith cannonballs which is profitable since one steel bar at 361 coins produces four cannonballs worth 596 coins total thus 235 coins profit. Depending on which furnace the player chooses one can produce between 2160 and 2400 cannonballs in an hour. That means the profit margin falls between 126900 and 141000 hourly.

 · The total feed to the ball-mill was therefore 11.54 T. per hr. or 179 per cent of the original feed. It was evident that the ball-mill was greatly underloaded in this test but so much trouble developed in the classifier due to the tendency of the sands to slip down the slopes that a more rapid feed was not attempted at this time.
