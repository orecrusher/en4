Iron ore is the key raw material for steel production enterprises. Generally iron ore with a grade of less than 50% needs to be processed before smelting and utilization. After crushing grinding magnetic separation flotation and gravity separation etc. iron is gradually selected from the natural iron ore.

 · The ambition of HYBRIT is to set up an iron production process with close-to-zero greenhouse gas emissions. The key component of this process is to remove the oxygen from iron ore not by using coke (from coal) but instead with hydrogen gas H 2. With this process the by-product of creating iron isn't carbon dioxide – it's water.

 · In a DRI furnace the iron ore is heated but not to the point of melting. Hydrogen then passes over the hot ore combining with oxygen liberated from the iron oxide to form water and leaving relatively pure iron behind. Typically that still-hot iron is then transferred to an electric furnace for additional processing to turn it into steel.
