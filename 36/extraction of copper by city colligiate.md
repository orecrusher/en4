## The Discovery of Metals 
The discovery that copper could also be obtained by heating Blue Stones or minerals (primarily copper sulfide ores) occurred between 4000 - 3000 BC. The extraction of Copper from Copper Sulfide Ores provided Man with another more abundant source of copper. Hence Metallurgy was born.

The mining industry uses sulphuric acid in the extraction and treatment of copper. The extraction processes are called heap and situ leaching; during these processes particles react with each other to create acidic mists that not only harm people's skin eyes and lungs but also destroy crops deteriorate the quality of the land and damage nearby buildings.

## Enhanced removal of copper by electroflocculation and 
The idea is immensely attractive if copper ions can be completely removed in wastewater. In this study a novel bioelectrochemical system assisted microelectrolysis was developed for the enhanced removal of copper. One abandoned aluminium was used as anode and graphite/activated carbon as biological anode and a bifunctional alytic conductive membrane as hode.
