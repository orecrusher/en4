## Introduction to CNC machining 
Face milling cutters are used to remove materials from large flat surfaces. They have a larger diameter than end mill tools so they require fewer passes to machine large areas reducing the total machining time and producing flat surfaces. A face milling step is often employed early in the machining cycle to prepare the dimensions of the block.

The balls are initially 5–10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel.

## SYNTHESIS OF NANO PARTICLES BALL MILLING METHOD
BALL MILLING Ball milling is a method of production of nano materials. This process is used in producing metallic and ceramic nano materials. These mills are equipped with grinding media composed of wolfram carbide or steel. Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.
