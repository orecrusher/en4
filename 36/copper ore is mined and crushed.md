## Ethical perspectives on mining and the use of copper 
One is called heap leaching where the mined ore is crushed into small chunks and heaped on an impermeable plastic or clay pad and irrigated with sulphuric acid to dissolve the valuable metals9. Heap leaching is lauded by companies for using less energy but in many cases copper ore is still refined using the smelting process.

## Heap leaching 
Heap leaching is an industrial mining process used to extract precious metals copper uranium and other compounds from ore using a series of chemical reactions that absorb specific minerals and re-separate them after their division from other earth materials. Similar to in situ mining heap leach mining differs in that it places ore on a liner then adds the chemicals via drip systems to the

Ore is processed using conventional techniques and differential flotation. Ore is passed to the primary crusher and crushed to 150mm. This is passed to the secondary and tertiary crushers and ground to 16mm. After milling the ore is fed into the flotation circuit. Following differential flotation zinc lead and copper concentrates are produced.
