## How to Maximize Grade and Recovery Curve
Generally we plot the grade and recovery in the form of a curve to illustrate their dependence variation among the process. The maximum recovery is 100% which refers to the raw material or the ore before beneficiation. But the ultimate grade of a substance in the ore is its value in the pure mineral. For example the lead grade in PBS is 86

## What is a theoretical grade
 · The theoretical grade-recovery curve for an ore is a definition of the maximum expected recovery by flotation of a mineral or element at a given grade. This is defined by the surface area liberation of the value minerals and is consequently directly related to the grind size utilised in the process. The theoretical grade-recovery can be readily used to quickly identify potential recovery
