## Tailings Paste Disposal – More than Water Recovery
 · Paste thickeners thicken tailings to higher underflow solids concentrations than conventional and high-rate thickeners. For example a tailings stream in an iron ore appliion could be thickened to 45-50% solids in conventional or high-rate thickeners. Conversely the same tailings stream could be thickened to 65-70% solids using a paste
