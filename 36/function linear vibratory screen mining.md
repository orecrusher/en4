## Vibrating Screens Linear Vibrating Screen Vibrating 
DZS linear vibrating screen is driven by double vibration motors. While two vibration motors doing synchronous rotation or counter rotation the exciting force generated by eccentric block is canceled out with transverse exciting force and the longitudinal exciting resultant force is passed on the whole screen surface of liner vibrating screen.

## 5 Vibrating Screen Common Problems And How To Solve? 
For linear vibrating screen and high frequency vibrating screen the poor screening quality may be related to the movement direction of eccentric block because two groups of eccentric blocks with the same mass need to rotate in self-synchronization and reverse direction to produce a single exciting force along the vibration direction at each instant which has a fixed angle with the

Vibrating screen troubleshooting 3 reasons：fracture of vibrating screen crossbeam. As follows: 1. Operational used factors. 1) Loose bolts. When Bolt Loosens the movement of the two vibrators will destroy the circulation of the inertia force of the beam. The exciting force produced by the vibrator impacts the crossbeam violently.

## Construction Working and Maintenance of Electric 
Thus unbalance exciters generate a linear vibratory motion. They are used to drive vibratory conveyors screens and other vibration systems with very high load and/or very high flow rates. It may be noted that working of unbalance exciters is similar to use of two counter-rotating unbalance motors to generate linear vibratory movement.

High-frequency vibrating screens are the most important screening machines primarily utilised in the mineral processing industry. They are used to separate feeds containing solid and crushed ores down to approximately 200 μm in size and are applicable to both perfectly wetted and dried feed. The frequency of the screen is mainly controlled by an electromagnetic vibrator which is mounted
