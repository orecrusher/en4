The Escondida porphyry copper deposit loed in northern Chile was one of the two largest copper producers of the world in the 1990s. The hydrothermal evolution of this deposit is associated with the emplacement of a late Eocene- Oligocene quartz monzonitic to granodioritic intrusive stock complex composed of at least three intrusive phases and hosted by Paleocene andesite.
