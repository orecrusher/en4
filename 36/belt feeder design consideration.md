## Feeder Optimisation and Design 
Feeder Optimisation and Design Feeders control the gravity flow of bulk solids from storage such as bins or stockpiles to provide a uniform feedrate to the receiving belt conveyor. It is vital that the type of feeder be chosen to suit the bulk material being handled and to provide the range of feed rates required.

Belt feeders use flat belts almost exclu-sively. This is because feeders are gener-ally very short and they must fit into operations where there is little room to form the belt into a trough. Feeders typi-cally operate with very high loads and use heavy-duty idlers. Many feeder belts can reverse direction. To move a large material

 · 6) Apron feeders always need variable speed drive. So maximum of variable speed range should correspond to design capacity which could be about 20% more than the guaranteed capacity. That means apron feeder will normally run below maximum range by certain margin. This provides room for selection of speed during field trials / setting.
