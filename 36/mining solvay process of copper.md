## Why copper is the metal of the future 
 · Copper metal is found in natural ore deposits around the globe. The metal is extracted through mining and processing. Copper is processed from ore-containing rock to its final product. As one of the highest-quality commercial metals copper production ensures the mineral is able to find its uses in many modern-day appliions.
