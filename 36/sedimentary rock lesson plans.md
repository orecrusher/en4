Rocks are normally separated into three main types: sedimentary igneous and metamorphic. Weathering and erosion are processes that break rocks into smaller pieces. These rock particles are transported by rivers and seas and deposited in new loions. Sedimentation occurs when layers of sediment build up.

Igneous rocks are composed of melted rock that hardens and cools. A few examples include obsidian and pumice. Show your students a picture of each example. Explain that the second type of rock is called sedimentary and they're formed from material that is settled into layers. The layers are squeezed until they harden into rock.

 · Sedimentary rocks are made from sediments – bits of dirt sand rocks shells bones etc. – that settle into layers. The older layers are on the bottom. They settled first. With a little bit of pressure and time the sediments stick together and form the rocks we see. If you have access to one show your child a rock core sample.
