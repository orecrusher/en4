## Use of limestone for pH control in autotrophic 
The dissolution rate of limestone is inversely proportional to pH for pH values lower than 7.1. It was found that the ratio of influent alkalinity to theoretically required alkalinity in the wastewater should not be lower than 0.5 in order to prevent a decrease in nitrate removal performance.

## What happens when acid reacts with limestone? 
 · Limestone is mostly made up of the mineral calcium carbonate (CaCO3). This is not very soluble so rocks don't dissolve very quickly. But if you add an acid you add hydrogen ions (H+) which will react with the carbonate to form hydrogen carbonate HCO3- ions which are very soluble in water and the limestone will dissolve. Or if there is more acid two hydrogen ions will

## Gear Reduction in Electric Motors 
 · The "reduction" or gear ratio is calculated by dividing the number of teeth on the large gear by the number of teeth on the small gear. For example if an electric motor drives a 13-tooth pinion gear that meshes with a 65-tooth gear a reduction of 5:1 is achieved (65 / 13 = 5). If the electric motor speed is 3450 rpm the gearbox reduces
