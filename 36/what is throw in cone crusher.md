## Mechanical screening 
Mechanical screening often just called screening is the practice of taking granulated ore material and separating it into multiple grades by particle size.. This practice occurs in a variety of industries such as mining and mineral processing agriculture pharmaceutical food plastics and recycling.. A method of separating solid particles according to size alone is called screening.

## How to Pick the Right Crusher 
Newer generation cone crushers – from the late 1980s on – made significant changes in the stroke and the throw and speed of the machines and that lends itself to a more cubical product. Cubicity can be better controlled with those types of machines provided you don't exceed what we call the ratio of reduction meaning just how far we are crushing a rock in a single stage.

While most crushers are engineered to open up due to tramp metal or an uncrushable – no cone crusher is designed to operate safely with bowl float or ring bounce – and when undetected it will most certainly lead to component failures.

## Crushers 
Cone crushers are used for intermediate and fine crushing after primary crushing. The key factor for the performance of a cone type secondary crusher is the profile of the crushing chamber or cavity. Therefore there is normally a range of standard cavities available for each crusher to allow selection of the appropriate cavity for the feed material in question.
