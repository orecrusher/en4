Gyratory crushers are also used as aggregate crushers. These types of crushers are similar to jaw crushers but employ a cone shaped hopper with a smaller cone-shaped crushing head that gyrates around the inside of the hopper in an eccentric movement rather than rotating crushing the source material until the particles are small

Key points. • 'Aggregate' is a term for any particulate material. It includes gravel crushed stone sand slag recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates. Aggregate may be natural manufactured or recycled. • Aggregates make up some 60 -80% of the concrete mix. They provide compressive strength and bulk to concrete.

Aggregate size is considered to include maximum size size range and gradation. The earliest bituminous mixtures used the finer aggregate sizes and are generally re-ferred to as sheet mixtures. When small amounts of coarser aggregates were added to the fine aggregate -bitumen mixture the mixtures were known as stone-filled sheet mixtures.
