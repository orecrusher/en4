Manganese (Mn) reactions in soil Manganese is abundant in Oregon soils; however most of it is unavailable for plant uptake. Plants can absorb Mn only when it occurs in solution as a divalent ion (Mn 2+). Mn is referred to as the reduced form. Mn also occurs in oxidized forms (Mn3+ and Mn4+) both of which are unavailable for plant uptake.
