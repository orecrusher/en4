## High pressure grinding rolls (HPGR) 
High pressure grinding rolls (HPGR) are used for size reduction or rocks and ores. They compress the feed material between two rotating rollers one of which is in a fixed position and another roller that is floating. The two rotating rollers generate such a high pressure that it grinds the feed material to the desired smaller grain size.
