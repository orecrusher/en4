## Specific gravity for coarse fine and sand aggregates 
 · Specific gravity is one of the various tests engineers do on aggregate in order to determine the most suitable aggregate and sand that fit with concrete mixture and the use of this mixture. Water absorption test is also an important test to do on aggregate because it helps the engineers to determine the exact water content in the mixture.

Determining The Specific Gravities Of Coarse. The current method of specific gravity and absorption of coarse aggregate testing is based on the aashto t 85 and astm c-127 standardshis approach involves the soaking of the coarse aggregate samples for 15h aashto t 85 and 24 4 h astm c-127 and drying the aggregate to its saturated-surface dry ssd state with the aid of a dry absorbent cloth.

## Bulk Specific Gravity Calculator
Bulk specific gravity of aggregates can be defined as the ratio of oven-dry weight of the aggregate to the bulk volume of the aggregate particles. It is the ratio of mass of the substance at the stated temperature to the mass of the volume of the distilled water at the specified temperature.

## Characteristics of Aggregates: Shape Size Specific Gravity
The Fine Aggregate Test (ASTM C128 and AASHTO T 84) is a comparison of sample masses in oven-dry saturated surface-dry (SSD) and immersed conditions. This test method offers alternate procedures to determine specific gravity. Either a volumetric flask or a simple pycnometer can be used for the gravimetric procedure. For the volumetric procedure a special Le Chatelier flask is needed.
