 · The kinetic aspects of the extraction of palladium(II) from hydrochloric acid by TTD and dioctyl sulphide (DOS) were compared. The rate of Pd extraction with TTD is considerably higher than that with DOS especially with chloroform. Combined use of a reducing agent and TTD enhances the extraction of gold(III) into 12-dichloroethane.
