 · Cyanide leach mining is a type of gold mining that uses cyanide to extract gold from the surrounding rock. First the rock that contains gold (the ore) is dug out of the ground leaving behind a large open pit. Then the ore is crushed into small pieces. The crushed ore is placed in large piles called heaps and sprayed with cyanide solution.
