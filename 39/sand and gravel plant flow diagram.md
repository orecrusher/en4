## Types Of Soil 
The first type of soil is sand. It consists of small particles of weathered rock. Sandy soils are one of the poorest types of soil for growing plants because it has very low nutrients and poor water holding capacity which makes it hard for the plant's roots to absorb water. This type of soil is very good for the drainage system.

Rate of flow. A flow of between 4 – 21 m/h can be expected from a rapid sand filter which is somewhere between 20 and 50 times faster than the range of slow sand filtration. Flow rates are usually around 0.1 m/h but can increase up to 0.4 m/h. Check out Flow Rates for more information. Filter media.
