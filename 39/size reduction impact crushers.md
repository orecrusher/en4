The most common mechanisms for the particle size reduction of solids are explained below. Please also note that usually various particle size reduction principles are combined in one mill

## Size Reduction Operation and Equipments 
 · There are four different size Reduction principles : (1) compression: compression force is applied for size Reduction. Solid particles which have to reduce size place between two solid walls and force is applied by both sides. (2) Impact: I this generally one wall side is fixed and from second impact force is applied on solid particles.

## GLOBAL MINING REVIEW 
 · Size reduction is accomplished by two primary methods: impact and compression. Impact crushers reduce size by initially impacting the feed material with rapidly moving hammers or blow bars. As material feeds through the crusher the size is further reduced by impacting with the walls of the unit and with the process material itself.

## Crusher 
The operation is similar to the standard cone crushers except that the size reduction is caused more by attrition than by impact [5]. The reduction ratio is around 8:1 and as the product size is relatively small the feed size is limited to less than 50 mm with a nip angle between 25° and 30°.
