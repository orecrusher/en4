## Mines Minerals and "Green" Energy: A Reality Check
 · While ore grades vary widely copper ores typically contain only about a half-percent by weight of the element itself: thus roughly 200 tons of ore are dug up moved crushed and processed to get to one ton of copper. For rare earths some 20 to 160 tons of ore are mined per ton of element.

## Mining Metals 
Mining companies around the world rely on processing equipment on their sites to bring ore and other extracted minerals down to a useable easily transportable product. For iron mines this often means reducing raw ore down to iron pellets for shipping to foundries while coal facilities process extracts on site into a form ready to fuel power stations.
