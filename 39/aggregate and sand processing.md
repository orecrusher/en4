## Natural Aggregate 
 · Natural aggregate consists of manufactured crushed stone and sand created by crushing bedrock or naturally occurring unconsolidated sand and gravel. It is a major component of asphalt and concrete and is required in streets highways railroads bridges buildings sidewalks sewers power plants and dams—just about every part of the built environment.

First the raw sand is placed on the conveyor. The dirt clay and large rocks are sorted out and removed from processing. This dirt and clay is unsaleable. Second the rock and pea gravel are sized and put into a washer and cleaned together then re-sorted by size. The washed rock is 7/16″ to 1.25″ and is used for gravel roads and drive ways.

Introduction. Sand and gravel are used extensively in construction. In the preparation of concrete for each tonne of cement the building industry needs about six to seven times more tonnes of sand and gravel (USGS 2013b). Thus the world's use of aggregates for concrete can be estimated at 25.9 billion to 29.6 billion tonnes a year for 2012 alone.
