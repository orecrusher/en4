## Gyratory Crusher 
A gyratory crusher includes a solid cone set on a revolving shaft and placed within a hollow body which has conical or vertical sloping sides. Material is crushed when the crushing surfaces approach each other and the crushed products fall through the discharging opening. Hammer crushers are used either as a one-step primary crusher or as a secondary crusher for products from a primary crusher.
