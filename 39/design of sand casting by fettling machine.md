Sand casting is one of the few available processes for metals with high melting temperatures such as steels nickel and titanium. Because of its flexibility heat resistance and relatively low cost sand casting is the most widely used casting process. Castings are produced by pouring liquid metal into a mold cavity.

## Casting and Forging 
 · CASTING AND FORGINGCastingCasting is pouring molten liquid into a mold where it is subsequently allowed to cool solidify before ejection for use. Casting is used for producing parts to near-net (i.e. near-final) shape. The molds can range from very cheap sand molds to elaborately machined chromium-steel molds costing well into the 6 figure range.

## Die Casting 
Die-castings are typically limited from 20 kg (55 lb) max. for Magnesium to 35 kg (77 lb) max. for Zinc. Large castings tend to have greater porosity problems due to entrapped air and the melt solidifying before it gets to the furthest extremities of the die-cast cavity. The porosity problem can be somewhat overcome by vacuum die casting
