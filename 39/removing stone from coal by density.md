 · Coal (IPA: /ˈkəʊl/) is a fossil fuel extracted from the ground by underground mining or open-pit mining (surface mining). It is a readily combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock. It is composed primarily of carbon along with assorted other elements including sulfur.Often associated with the Industrial Revolution coal remains an enormously important fuel.
