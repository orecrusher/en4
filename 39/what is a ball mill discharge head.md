Hydropower all comes down to head and flow. The amount of power and therefore energy that you can generate is proportional to the head and the flow. Diagram of measuring head at high head hydropower site. Head is the change in water levels between the hydro intake and the hydro discharge point. It is a vertical height measured in metres.

Overview of Ion Milling Methods. Ion milling uses the phenomenon of sputtering 2) —in which atoms are ejected from a sample surface irradiated by ions accelerated by an electric field—to produce millimeter-order smooth surfaces for observation. The ionic material used is typically argon gas which induces minimal chemical transformation for most sample compositions.

Attrition mill is similar to a ball mill where grinding balls are loaded in to a horizontal cylinder and rotated to perform the milling action. However in attraction mills the vertical drum is attached with series of carefully positions impellers inside. These impellers are fixed to have right angles to each other.

 · A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis. The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 – 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.

## HOW TO design a pump system
The total head is equal to the difference between the pressure head at the discharge H D and the pressure head at the suction H S. H S is equal to –15 feet because it is a lift therefore: H D = 100 + (-15) = 85 feet. The discharge pressure will be: Now you can check your pump to see if the measured discharge pressure matches the prediction.

## Grinding control strategy on the conventional milling 
the mill discharge from ball mill 1 will increase. With the same water addition to sump 1 the particle size of Cyclone 1 overflow will increase. This will decrease the ratio and hence the control loop will add more water to keep the ratio constant. However the amount of slurry reporting as fresh feed to the second milling circuit will increase.

Feature. Featuring 4 peripheral flutes for strength and rigidity but with only 2 ball end flutes for superior chip discharge. The uniquely developed DLC coating provides excellent welding resistance during high speed machining and when the coolant supply is reduced. Additionally the low coefficient of friction reduces cutting resistance.
