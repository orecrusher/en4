## The potential exposure and hazards of copper 
 · 1. Introduction. Copper is an essential element used for metabolic processes in humans and animals (Bhattacharya et al. 2016).It is needed for cross-linking connective tissue as well as in iron and lipid metabolism; however it induces toxicity at high exposure concentrations (Siddiqui et al. 2013).Elemental copper exists naturally in the environment as metallic copper in its zero-valent
