## Belt Bucket Elevator Design 
 ·  Bucket elevators operate by using an endless belt or chain on which rectangular buckets are mounted. This belt or chain revolves between a top and bottom pulley and the buckets move with it.  At the bottom the buckets pick up product fed into the elevator boot and at the top the product is discharged as the bucket turns downward over head

## Bucket Elevators 
Bucket elevators use an endless belt or chain and have a series of buckets attached to it. Bulk material is spread into an inlet hopper. Buckets dig into the material and convey it up and over the head sprocket/pulley and then throw the material out a discharge throat. Bucket elevators are not self-feeding and are fed at a controlled rate.

Continuous bucket elevators have buckets spaced continuously and operate at slower speeds. The continuous bucket placement allows the force of gravity to discharge their load onto the inverted front of the proceeding bucket. The bucket then guides that material into the discharge throat on the descending side of the elevator. Because every
