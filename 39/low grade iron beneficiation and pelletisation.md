## Beneficiation of low
Jun 01 2021 · As high-grade iron ore deposits are gradually being depleted more difficult-to-process ores such as goethite-rich low-grade iron ores and tailings are now being processed. These ores often contain impurities and require some form of beneficiation in order to achieve the typical grades required for sale to downstream steel producers.
