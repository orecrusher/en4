The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher. The essential difference is that the shorter spindle of the cone crusher is not suspended as in the gyratory but is supported in a curved universal bearing below the gyratory head or cone (Figure 8.2). Power is transmitted from the source to the countershaft to a V-belt or direct drive.
