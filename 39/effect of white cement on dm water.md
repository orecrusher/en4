## Rain's Effect on Fresh Concrete
 · The biggest problem you may be faced with is the effect the rain may have had on the surface of the concrete. If it was not covered prior to the onset of the rain if the hardening was not very far along by that time and if there was enough rain falling with enough force the rain may have washed some of the cement out of the concrete.

## Alkali
ASR is caused by a reaction between the hydroxyl ions in the alkaline cement pore solution in the concrete and reactive forms of silica in the aggregate (eg: chert quartzite opal strained quartz crystals). A gel is produced which increases in volume by taking up water and so exerts an expansive pressure resulting in failure of the concrete.
