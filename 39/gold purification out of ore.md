## Day 51 Procedures to obtain gold: Vat Leaching Process 
 · Treatment of ore is site-specific as determined by metallurgical tests. Bench scale metallurgical testing of ores for their amenability to vat leaching is similar to that for heap leaching. First bottle-roll tests of finely ground material are run to determine the ultimate recovery of gold and for any preg-robbing characteristics of the ore.

## Using Borax Flux to Refine Gold 
 · While out in the field a gold prospector can grind and wash a piece of ore then mix it with borax in a plastic bag. The bag is then placed in a bowl or crucible and heated. The heating action is what triggers the borax to go to work. Once the borax melts it lowers the melting temperatures of everything in the ore.

The gold-silver alloy remaining is almost free from impurities these being usually less than three parts per thousand. In ordinary practice this precaution is not taken but the retorted gold is broken up and melted in graphite crucibles.
