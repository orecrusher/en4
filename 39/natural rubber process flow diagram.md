However rubber articles can also be moulded using this technique. The polymer is preheated in a cylindrical chamber a temperature at which it will flow and is then forced into a comparatively cold closed mould cavity by means of high pressure. A great advantage of the process is the speed with which the articles can be produced in seconds.
