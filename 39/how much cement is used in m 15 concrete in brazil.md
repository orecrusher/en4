 · How Much Gravel do I Need – Concrete is a mixture of sand gravel cement and water. When wet it can be formed in different ways. When it hardens or sets it becomes like rock. It is used to bond bricks or stones or to make walls walkways and sidewalks. The exact ratio of ingredients used confers its particular properties of concrete.
