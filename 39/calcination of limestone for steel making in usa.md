## Calcination 
Calcination of limestone takes places essentially at about 1000 °C. The reaction is highly endothermic and consumes large amount of thermal energy (1.1.26) that comes from the burning of coke. Furthermore limestone decomposition releases CO 2 gas and the CO 2 gas will react further with coke through Boudouard reaction (1.1.27) leading to extra solution loss of carbon.

Crushed limestone also acts as a base to make roads. The product is frequently used for bedding underground pipes owing to its ability to not contract and expand thereby preserving the integrity of pipeline. In building construction appliion high-purity limestone is used for removing impurities in metal refining processes such as smelting.
