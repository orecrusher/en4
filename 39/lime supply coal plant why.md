## How does coke and coal play into steel making? 
 · It is produced by baking coal until it becomes carbon by burning off impurities without burning up the coal itself. When coke is consumed it generates intense heat but little smoke making it ideal for smelting iron and steel. Prior to the 1880's steel was produced using charcoal. By 1920 nearly 90% of US steel was produced using coke.
