Jun 15 2021 · ABSTRACT Dust agglomeration in an electrostatic precipitator (EP) during the sintering process taking place in an ironmaking plant was investigated. The dust agglomeration in the high sulfur flue gas dust hopper of the EP was very serious and did affect the removal of the dust from the hopper. The size of the agglomerate ranged from approximately 30–50 cm and was found to exhibit strong

## What is Agglomeration? 
Sintering. Sintering also known as frittage is a thermal agglomeration process during which the atoms within the materials diffuse and form bridges across distinct particles joining them together. Sintering involves heating products without melting them and as such is particularly well-suited for materials with very high melting points.

in sintering the endothermic peak would somewhat shift to a lower temperature for the sintering samples. Thus liquid- phase sintering is probably operative in the doped alumina. Moreover the presence of a liquid phase is known to render sintering more forgiving to processing flaws introduced by unsatisfactory powder packing processes.
