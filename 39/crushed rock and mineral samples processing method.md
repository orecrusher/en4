 · Once you have everything crushed down to fine texture it is a simple matter of just panning out the contents. You will be left with just the gold. Now is when you will find out if your shiny rocks actually contain gold or not. If that shiny stuff is actually mica chalcopyrite or some other light mineral you will lose it in the panning process.

Once the ore has been mined it is usually crushed into smaller pieces that can be processed more easily. The mineral then needs to be removed from the ore. Ancient peoples soon learnt that fire could be used to refine and purify the metals. This technique is known as smelting. This was the earliest method used to extract the mineral from the ore.

 · To determine the approximate age of a rock samples are crushed and then mounted onto epoxy pucks. The samples are then blasted with lasers and heated to temperatures as hot as the surface of the sun to break them down into their constituent atoms. The chemical makeup and age are then determined using the mass spectrometers in the lab.

Legacy crushed rock analysis as applied to unconventional shales has shown great success in evaluating total porosity and water saturation over the previous two decades. The procedure of crushing rock into small particles improves the efficiency of fluid recovery and grain volume measurements in a laboratory environment.
