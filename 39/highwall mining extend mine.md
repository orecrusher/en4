## Analysis of Highwall Mining Stability 
production method analysis shows that auger and highwall mining appears to be as safe as surface coal mining (6). However there are geotechnical considerations with highwall mining that require careful engineering to realize the full economic and safe potential of highwall mining. Highwall stability is the overriding concern in highwall mining.
