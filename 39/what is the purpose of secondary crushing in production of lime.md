## How Cement Is Made

## Pebble lime coolers 
Pebble lime calcining is a process by which carbonates of calcium and magnesium (CaCO 3 and MgCO 3) or limestone collectively are heated to temperatures high enough to drive off CO 2 and produce oxides of calcium and magnesium (CaO and MgO) lime product. The process takes place within three major pieces of equipment—preheater rotary kiln and stationary cooler.
