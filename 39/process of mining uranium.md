## In Situ Leach and Conventional Uranium
Jul 28 2021 · From 1972 through 1985 uranium recovery in Texas was dominated by conventional mining and milling. More recently companies (licensees) have been using In Situ Leaching (ISL) a process that makes possible the recovery of uranium without disturbing the natural surface generating dust or producing waste known as tailings.

Uranium mining in the Four Corners region grew from existing vanadium mining operations. Companies like the U.S. Vanadium Corporation (a subsidiary of Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation) and the Vanadium Corporation of America scoured the area for carnotite deposits extracting vanadium that would then be used to improve steel alloy.
