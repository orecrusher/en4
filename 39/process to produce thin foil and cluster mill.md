A reliable etching process for 75µm structures is only possible with thin copper thicknesses (maximum 25 - 30µm). Printed circuit boards with plated-through holes always require additional processes in order to deposit enough copper in the holes and also to reduce the copper build-up on the surface compared with the standard.

If the foil is too thin more radiation arrives at the detector. The computer sees that the level of radiation is too high and sends a signal to the rollers to make the gap bigger. The bigger gap makes the aluminium foil thicker until the amount of radiation at the detector falls back to its normal level.
