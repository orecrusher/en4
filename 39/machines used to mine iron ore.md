## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth? 
 · Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining. The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however because iron does not occur naturally it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.

In order to mine iron ore underground we have to build transport routes in the rock i.e. tunnels known as drifts. Development consequently entails making preparations for mining. A development drift is blasted directly through the ore body and if necessary the walls and roof are reinforced with bolts mesh and sprayed concrete.
