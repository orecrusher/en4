The result is that metal mining activities are expanding and more and more of the world's metal stocks are above ground in use rather than below ground as unused reserves. An example is the in-use stock of copper. Between 1932 and 1999 copper in use in the USA rose from 73 kilograms (161 lb) to 238 kilograms (525 lb) per person.
