During mining operations enormous amounts of groundwater are drained from aquifers so mining companies can access coal seams – up to 10000 litres per tonne of coal. A series of proposed mines in Australia's Galilee Basin is projected to extract 1343 gigalitres of water – over 2-1/2 times the amount of water in the Sydney Harbor.

## Background review 
Background review: subsidence from coal mining activities Major underground coal mining in Australia mainly occurs in the coal basins of New South Wales and Queensland. Longwall is currently the most common method of underground coal mining in Australia as it is safer and more efficient in extracting coal than other extraction techniques.
