Using gravity concentration to optimize gold recovery is now a necessity in today's competitive mineral industry.. At Sepro our goal is to help you squeeze out every ounce of gold from your recovery circuit. While froth flotation and cyanide leaching both play major roles in gold recovery the benefits of using gravity concentrators cannot be understated.

 · The problem with using acids like this with "gold ore" is that other metals are almost always present in the ore with the gold so once you dissolve the gold into solution other metals are also spoiling the mix which makes removing the gold even harder to do. Sulfuric Acid will "not" dissolve gold. It is used mainly in "electrowinning".
