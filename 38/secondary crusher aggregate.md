Crusher itself. New generation cones will produce considerably better shape than so called old generation. This is due to improved crusher kinematics and shape of cavity. Closed circuit. This improves shape by attrition gives constant feed curve and recrushing of flaky product. In secondary stages closed circuit calibrates feed to tertiaries.

 · The primary crusher usually reduces material down to 60-80 mm which is fed into a secondary crusher. The material from the secondary crushing then passes through two screens that separate the aggregate into sizes greater than 19 mm between 19 mm and 7 mm with the material finer than 7 mm being removed (and used as road metal).
