## Resource policies and small
 · This article examines the policy framework in place for small-scale gold mining in Zimbabwe. Through an analysis of stakeholder interviews and industry performance the paper argues that the main government initiatives to manage gold mining in recent years have proved counterproductive as economic returns from minerals have hemorrhaged due to increased illegal activity.

## Does the mining industry have a future in Zimbabwe 
 · The mining sector landscape in Zimbabwe presents an interesting scenario owing to the large- and small-scale mining operations and opportunities. The extraction of minerals such as platinum-group metals is ideally suited to large-scale mining while other minerals such as gold can be more suited small-scale mining.

## The Mercury Problem in Artisanal and Small‐Scale Gold Mining
 · Mercury-dependent artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is the largest source of mercury pollution on Earth. In this practice elemental mercury is used to extract gold from ore as an amalgam. The amalgam is typically isolated by hand and then heated—often with a torch or over a stove—to distill the mercury and isolate the gold.
