Value. A vector containing the number of components for each graph in dat. Details. The connected parameter corresponds to the rule parameter of component.dist.By default components returns the number of strong components but other component types can be returned if so desired. (See component.dist for details.) For symmetric matrices this is obviously a moot point.
