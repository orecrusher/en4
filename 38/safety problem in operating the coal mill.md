## COAL HANDLING SAFETY 
 · Risks of unwanted combustion – potentially causing injury damage and downtime – occur everywhere that coal is handled processed or stored. Safe coal handling practices are designed to ensure that the fuel remains intact throughout its journey from the mine until the point at which it is ignited in the boiler. It takes as little as 1.4 kg (3 lbs) of pulverised coal in 28 m3 (1000 ft3) of air to form an explosive mixture. Since a large boiler burns over 40 kg (88 lbs) or more of coal per second the safe burning of pulverised coal necessitates strict adherence to planned operating
