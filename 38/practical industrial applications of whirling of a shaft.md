## How spur gears are used? Manufacturing appliion OEM 
 · Spur gears are basically cylinders or disks with radially projecting teeth that have straight edges and are aligned parallel to the axis of rotation. The gears are mounted on to parallel shafts so that the teeth can mesh together and transfer motion and power. Spur gears are the simplest and most common kind of gears and are therefore the first choice in most gear appliions.

INTRODUCTION A shaft is a mechanical component which is used for power transmission in automobiles and also used in industrial purpose like power houses in turbines compressors shafts are used to transmit power from source to system it is a rotating member. It has mostly replaced the older version of shafts. The reciproing piston engine consists crank shaft which is used to convert reciproing motion into rotary motion with the help of the web mounted on a shaft for more power and torque transmission shaft has greater used on various purpose of power transmission and industrial appliions.

 · At this point the deflection increases greatly and the shaft is said to "whirl". Below and above this speed this effect is very much reduced. This critical (whirling speed) is dependent on the shaft dimensions the shaft material and the shaft loads. All rotating shafts even in the absence of external load deflect during rotation.
