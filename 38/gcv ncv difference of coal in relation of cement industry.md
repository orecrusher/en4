## What is the difference between gross and net calorific 
Net Calorific Value (NCV) also known as lower heating value (LHV) or lower calorific value (LCV) is determined by subtracting the heat of vaporization of the water vapour from the higher heating value. This treats any H 2 0 formed as a vapor. Natural gas prices are decided on the basis of GCV and NCV.

## High fuel consumption 
 · Re: High fuel consumption. The difference between GCV and NCV looks ok as the South African coal haveing about 4 to 5 % hydrogen. SO i feel there is no big differnce. e.g if coal having 4.5 % hydrogen then the heat taken by water for steam is ~ 236 Kcal/Kg if South African coal of you specs (GCV=6206 Kcal/Kg) is taken for calculation purpose of NCV than deduct 236Kcal/Kg from GCV.
