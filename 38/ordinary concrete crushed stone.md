## Mechanical and Microstructural Properties of Ordinary 
This study investigates the use of crushed glass waste as partial cement replacement in ordinary concretes. Six concrete mixes were designed and prepared: a reference without substitution and five substitution percentages of crushed glass waste ranging from 5% to 25%. The made concrete mix design underwent different tests namely: slump test mechanical strength thermogravimetric analysis

## Common Types Of Sand Used In Construction
Crushed Stone Sand. It looks like gravel and feels like gravel. But unlike gravel crushed stone sand is a natural but commercially created resource that is made from crushed minerals such as granite or limestone. Crushed stone sand is commonly used for road construction and is widely known as a low-cost high-value commodity.

## The Difference Between Cement And Concrete
Concrete is a mixture of cement water and aggregates. Aggregates make up approximately 60-75% of the mixture and cement and water make up the rest. Aggregates are usually inert course materials like gravel crushed stone sand or recycled concrete. The type of aggregate selected depends on the appliion of the concrete.

 · Cement is an ingredient of concrete whereas concrete is a mixture of aggregates water and cement. The aggregates can be sand gravel or crushed stone. Cement acts as a binder a substance that sets and hardens as it dries. Cement reacts with carbon dioxide in the air dependently and binds the aggregates together resulting to a rock-like mass.

Nov 11 2019 Parts of crushed stone are commonly used as aggregates for ready mix concrete. Concrete plants keep large quantities of different parts of crushed stone on hand to make their concrete batches. Crushed stone with stone dust in it is highly compactable and is therefore commonly used when making any kind of base for construction.get price

## Ordinary Portland Cement: Uses Advantages Disadvantages
Introduction to ordinary Portland cement: Ordinary Portland cement is one of the most widely used cement. The name Portland cement was given by Joseph Aspdin in 1824 due to its similarity in colour and high quality when it hardened like a Portland stone. Portland stone is white grey limestone within the island of Portland Dorset.
