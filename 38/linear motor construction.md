## How do linear motors work? A simple introduction to maglev
 · Linear motors are electric induction motors that produce motion in a straight line rather than rotational motion. In a traditional electric motor the rotor (rotating part) spins inside the stator (static part); in a linear motor the stator is unwrapped and laid out flat and the "rotor" moves past it in a straight line.

## What is a linear motor? 
What is a linear motor? If you were to slice a rotary servo motor and lay it flat you would have essentially a linear motor. The rotor with permanent magnets becomes the stationary part of the linear motor (also called the secondary or magnet plate) and the stator which contains the coil windings becomes the moving part (also called the primary or coil unit).
