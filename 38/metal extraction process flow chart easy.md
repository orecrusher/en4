 · There are different steps involved in extraction of metals. Let us discuss them one by one: 1. Crushing and Grinding. First of all ores are crushed into a fine powder in big jaw crushers and ball mills. This method is called pulverization. 2. Concentration (Dressing) of ores. The technique of removing gangue the rocky impurities like Sio 2

## Tin Extraction 
However the tin concentrate grade of 40% is required meaning the enrichment of hundreds or thousands times. Targeting at the refractory tin ore low grade tin concentrate is obtained and it has to be further extracted by special metallurgy process. Reduction smelting is the dominant process to extract tin metal from tin concentrate.
