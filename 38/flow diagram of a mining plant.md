## What is a Process Flow Diagram? 
 · Process Flow Diagram (PFD) is a commonly used chart in chemical engineering and process engineering demonstrating the ongoing production flow of chemicals and other types of equipment involved. The concept of the process flow diagram was first pointed out by Frank Gilbreth an American industrial engineer in the 1920s.

## Block Flow Diagram Guide for Modeling Chemical Processes
A block flow diagram (BFD) is a drawing of chemical processes used to simplify and understand the basic structure of a system suggested by Peters Timmerhaus in 2003. A BFD is the simplest form of the flow diagrams used in the industry. Blocks in a BFD can represent anything from a single piece of equipment to an entire plant.
