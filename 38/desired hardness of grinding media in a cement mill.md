 · The grinding function is a non monotonic function of the level of material z in the mill reaching a maximum for some critical value of z. When z is too high the grinding efficiency decreases and leads to the obstruction of the mill. This nonlinearity can cause circuit instability a phenomenon called "plugging" as shown in fig.2. The plugging phenomenon manifests itself under the form of a dramatic decrease of the production and an irreversible accumulation of material in the mill due to intermittent disturbances of the inflow rate and variations of clinker hardness.
