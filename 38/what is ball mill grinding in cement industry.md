## Cement Cooling System 
The cooling of cement is an important step prior to storage in mitigating gypsum dehydration and subsequent moisture liberation which can lead to lump formation. Recommendations vary but it is generally accepted that with mill outlet temperatures of around 110ºC – 120ºC cooling to below 80ºC is necessary to avoid this reaction.
