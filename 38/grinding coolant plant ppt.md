The synthetic coolants do not transfer heat as well as oils but the flow possible in grinding appliions more than makes up for that. In addition open grinding such as flat exposed surfaces throws a great deal of coolant into the air in various size droplets. Oil based coolants are more likely to trap and contain metals and particles.
