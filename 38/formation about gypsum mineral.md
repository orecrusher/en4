 · Gypsum. Pure gypsum is hydrous calcium sulphate (CaSO 4 .2H 2 O). It is a soft mineral white when pure but of varying shades of grey yellow red or brown if impure. The main use for Victorian gypsum is for agricultural soil conditioning although demand for this fluctuates in response to the rural economy and climatic conditions.

Chemical names for the three hydration states of calcium sulfate are dihydrate hemihydrate and anhydrous or anhydrate respectively.

## How Is Gypsum Formed? 
 · Gypsum rock is first mined or quarried then crushed and ground to a fine powder. It then goes through a process called calcining where heat at 350 degrees is supplied to the gypsum powder which removes 3/4th of the water molecules. Hemihydrate is the name of calcined gypsum which is then used in gypsum board gypsum plaster and other products.

## Little Known Facts about Gypsum 
 · gypsum can be in the form of sand and in arid and sandy conditions gypsum can also form as desert rose a rosette formation with sand inclusions. • Gypsum is water soluble and forms by evaporation or as a result of the mineral anhydrite being hydrated.

 · Gypsum is a non-metallic mineral found in rock form. It is composed of 79.1% calcium sulphate and 20.9% water by weight. Chemists call it Hydrous Calcium Sulphate and as there is one molecule of calcium sulphate combined with two molecules of water. It has the chemical formula CaSO 4 2H 2 0. By volume this works out to nearly 50% water in

Taking the form CaSO 4 ·2H 2 O gypsum is one of the most common minerals on Earth yet its formation from ions in solution remains uncertain. Now researchers have used the Small Angle Stering and Diffraction beamline to follow the formation of gypsum in situ for the first time.

This study thus links the formation mechanism of authigenic gypsum with the oxidation of authigenic pyrite and evolution of underlying methane hydrates. These findings suggest that authigenic gypsum may be a useful proxy for recognition of SMTZs and methane hydrate zones in modern and ancient marine methane hydrate geo-systems.
