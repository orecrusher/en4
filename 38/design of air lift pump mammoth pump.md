## Design of Air
Guidelines for the optimal design of three-phase flow air-lift pumps for continuus sand filters are derived from empirical full-scale tests. The influence of riser-tube diameter air-injector type and position and degree of submergence is accounted for.

## Air Lift Pumps 
 · I am designing an Air Lift Pump: a submerged pipe that has outside source of compressed air introduced in order to raise the working fluid using buoyancy and expansion effects. I have found some technical resources which have been fairly useful but I was wondering if anyone had any practical experience or some tips for working with these devices.

An Air-Operated Double-Diaphragm pump (AODD) is a type of positive displacement (PD) pump. It consists of two pumping chambers that are alternately filled and discharged by the movement of flexible diaphragms. Compressed air is alternately fed to and vented from air chambers on the opposite sides of the diaphragms to create the pumping action.

Centrifugal Pumps. These types of pumps are most commonly used worldwide. The working is very simple described well and carefully tested.

## Performance Characteristics of Airlift Pumps with Vortex 
pumps lift water vertically from the point of air injection to the point of discharge from the riser. Typical airlift pump discharge characteristics for a one inch diameter pipe are shown in Figure 2. The volumetric flow rate of the water shown on the ordinate in Figure 2 clearly depends upon the air injection flow rate shown on the abscissa.

6.2.2.2 Air-Lift Pumps Air lift pumps (as in notation 1 in Table 6.5 and Figure 6.3 d). These are used in small extended aeration plants to return the sludge and scum to the aeration tank. Small air bubbles are formed in the liquid which makes the air-water mixing less dense to get lifted to the discharge point.
