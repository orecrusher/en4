## Re
The technical and economic feasibility or re-processing hundreds of millions of tons of tailings in a number of historic gold tailings dams in the Witwatersrand area of South Africa is being investigated. The objective is to recover uranium and residual gold from the tailings as well as to oxidize the sulphides to eliminate long term environmental liabilities associated with acid mine drainage. The tailings from the re-processing plant will be re-deposited in a new area far from urbanization allowing for the rehabilitation of the real estate currently occupied by these historic tailings.
