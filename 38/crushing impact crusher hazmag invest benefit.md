## Impact crushers 
Impact crushers are named after the method they use in reducing larger blocks of rocks to smaller grain sizes. As the name suggests an impact crusher accelerates the feed material to high speed and then flings the fast-moving rocks against the walls of the crushing chamber and each other.

## The Benefits of Cubical Aggregate 
Crushing in an impact crusher takes place when the stone is struck by the spinning impact bars and by that stone being flung against an apron. When impact crushing is used the striking of the aggregate by the spinning rotor's blow bars knocks off or breaks the elongated fractures. This process is repeated by an impactor in the secondary stage.
