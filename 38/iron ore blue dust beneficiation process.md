Iron ore pellets undergo mechanical wear during handling transportation and use in a blast furnace. This results in a loss of valuable raw materials and causes environmental problems in form of dust in off-gases from a blast furnace. Thus this study is focused on the investigation of the mechanical wear of iron ore pellets and the dust formation.
