## BrainWave crushing 
BrainWave crushing is also able to take into account the transportation time present in the crushing process due to the various feed and conveyor systems and still maintain a stable level in the crusher. Maintaining the crusher in a choked condition allows ore to be crushed more efficiently since there will be more rock-on-rock crushing.

 · Toward sustainability by bridging the gap in comminution - from finely crushed ore to stirred media milling. ABSTRACT Mining consumes approximately 7% of the world's energy from which almost half goes for comminution. Since the crushers are more energy efficient than mills it is logic to push down-sizing in crushing stage (s) as far as possible.
