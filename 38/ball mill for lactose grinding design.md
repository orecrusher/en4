## CALCULATION OF THE POWER DRAW OF DRY 
 · To determine the power that a dry grinding needs full grate discharge mill Equation 1 is multiplied by the factor of 1.08. A multi-compartment ball mill consists of two or more grate discharge ball mills in series. The same equation is used to calculate the power that each ball mill compartment should draw. The total power is the sum of the power calculated for each of the separate compartments.
