Open cast mining is the removal of rocks or sediments that contains minerals with economically important elements. The advantages of open cast mining: • More cost effective than shaft mining. • The working conditions are safe for miners there is no risk of toxic gases or cave ins. • Trucks and mining machinery can move around freely.
