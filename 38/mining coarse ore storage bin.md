The ratio of waste rock/ore is called stripping ratio. For example a stripping ratio of 2:1 means that 2 tonnes of waste rock needs to be removed to mine 1 tonne of ore. Generally an open pit mine has a higher stripping ratio than an underground mine. Waste rock is often deposited in piles or heaps close to the mine to minimize transports.
