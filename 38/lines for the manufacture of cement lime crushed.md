Portland cement is made by fusing together two types of materials: (i) Calcareous (or rich in lime) such as lime- stone chalk alkali waste. (ii) Argillaceous (or rich in alumina or silica) such as clay shale slate etc. The main raw materials for the manufacture of cement are first crushed separately in a suitable machine.
