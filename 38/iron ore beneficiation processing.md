## Iron ore pelletizing 
Iron ore can be upgraded to a higher iron ore content through beneficiation This process generates iron ore filter cake which needs to be pelletized to be used in the steel making process. Also during the processing of high grade iron ores which don't need beneficiated fines which are generated can be pelletized and used instead of being disposed of.

## What Is Iron Ore Beneficiation? (with pictures)
Iron ore beneficiation is a multi-stage process that raw iron ore undergoes to purify it prior to the process of smelting which involves melting the ore to remove the metal content. The process of iron ore beneficiation has two complementary goals and these define the methods used to refine it.

## Beneficiation of iron ore 
U.S. Pat. No. to Bishop describes ore beneficiation and particularly froth flotation applied to iron ore. The beneficiation process described enables direct flotation of the iron oxide. This process however is not as efficient when dealing with fine grained ores as is the present process.

## Summary of Iron Ore Beneficiation Process and Technology 
There are many mineral processing methods and there are two commonly used methods (1). Roasting magnetic separation Roasting magnetic separation is one of the effective methods to separate fine to fine (< 0.02mm) weakly magnetic iron ore. When the minerals in ore are complex and it is difficult to get good indexes by other methods magnetization roasting magnetic separation should be used.
