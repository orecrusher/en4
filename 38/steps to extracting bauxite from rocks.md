## Bauxite Mining and Alumina Refining: Process Description 
 · Bauxite is a residual rock formed from the weathering of various igneous sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. These parent rocks have been exposed to long periods (millions of years) of weathering under tropical subtropical or very wet temperate conditions. Ninety percent of the known world bauxite resources are in tropical loions.
