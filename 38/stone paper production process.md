## List of Chemicals used in Pulp and Paper Making
 · CHEMICALS USED IN PULP PAPER MANUFACTURING AND COATING. While there are about 3000 or so different types of chemicals which "can be used" in papermaking in practice only about 200 individual chemicals are typically used each satisfying a specific need.

## How Paper is Made? 
 · Apart from the wood itself water is the most important ingredient of the process. At least 100L of water is required to make 1kg of paper. However engineers have devised clever ways to ensure that very little water is wasted. Almost 90% of the water is recycled by soaking or recirculating it on a mesh of pipes throughout the long process.

One of the most common appliions is for the sulfite-pulping process. This process uses acid to dissolve the glue (lignin) that holds the fibers (cellulose) together. When acidic water discharged from this process is neutralized lime is the reagent of choice in order to safely elevate the pH of the effluent stream prior to discharge.

The overwhelming majority (about 95 percent) of the raw material used to make paper though comes from trees. To make paper from trees the raw wood must first be turned into "pulp." Wood pulp is a watery "soup" of cellulose wood fibers lignin water and the chemicals used during the pulping process.
