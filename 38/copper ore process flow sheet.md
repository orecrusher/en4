## Gold
 · 1. Introduction. The association of gold and copper mineralization in commercially viable ore is a common occurrence. At one end of the spectrum is the predominantly copper ore which contains levels of gold mineralization. This would be uneconomic to mine for its gold content but the gold provides a significant opportunity value.

## Extraction of Copper and Zinc 
 · 1) Concentration: The ore is concentrated by froth floatation process. 2) Roasting: Concentrated ore is roasted in the presence of excess of air at about 1200 K to convert zinc sulphide into zinc oxide. 2ZnS + 3O 2 ——> 2ZnO + 2SO 2. Sulphur dioxide gas evolved in this process may be used in the manufacture of sulphuric acid.

 · The copper industry comprises both the primary copper industry which produces 99.9%-pure copper from copper ore and the secondary copper industry which salvages and recycles copper-containing scrap metal to extract pure copper or copper alloys. The United States uses about 2 million tons of copper annually 60% of it for electrical appliions.
