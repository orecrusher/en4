## Experimental investigation of unbalance and misalignment 
Unbalance and misalignment are the main causes of vibration in rotating machinery. Vibration analysis is the important tool for fault diagnosis in rotating machinery. In this paper order analysis technique of vibration analysis for unbalance and misalignment fault diagnosis is proposed. In order analysis both phase and amplitude are obtained.
