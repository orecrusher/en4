## DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF IMPACT CRUSHERS
 · A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large solid chunks of raw material into smaller chunks. Crushers are commonly classified by the degree to which they fragment not starting material with wares crushers not reducing it by much intermediate cruiser fragmenting it much more significantly and grinders reducing it to a fine power.
