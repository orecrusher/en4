Based on an nth order model of the grinding process the theory is also applied to the calculation of suitable ball media composition for an industrial continuous mill. The change in ball media composition as calculated using the model results in a 20% increase in production from an industrial mill.

Ball Mill an overview ScienceDirect Topics. The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media. The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1–1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating or slurry containing 20–40% water by weight.

 · Ball Mill Working Principle. Grinding is usually performed wet although in certain appliions dry grinding is used. When the mill is rotated the mixture of medium ore and water known as the mill charge is intimately mixed; the medium comminuting the particles depends on the speed of rotation of the mill and the shell liner structure.
