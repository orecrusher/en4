Ultrasonic assisted grinding (UAG) has been considered as a prominent processing method of the reaction bonded silicon carbide (RBSiC). To improve the knowledge of UAG process both conventional grinding (CG) and UAG were used to process the RBSiC for in-depth investigation. Grinding forces surface topographies and subsurface damages during CG and UAG were compared.
