## What makes combined cycle power plants so efficient?
 · A combined cycle power plant relies on the simple fact that a gas turbine produces both power and hot exhaust gases. As the power is channeled to a generator the hot gases are used to produce steam. This steam runs a steam turbine to produce extra power.
