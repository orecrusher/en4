 · Work towards ideal sinter performance even with a low grade ore If you understand the properties of your ore and what you can and can't do with it then you can optimise performance. Key to this is to avoid making an immediate value judgement — on the basis of chemistry — that the presence of certain impurities will have a negative impact on your ore.
