 · Bentonite usually forms from weathering of volcanic ash most often in the presence of water. However the term bentonite as well as a similar clay called tonstein has been used for clay beds of uncertain origin. For industrial purposes two main classes of bentonite exist: sodium and calcium bentonite.

## Recycling Industrial Minerals 
 · Bentonite due to its viscosity and plasticity is also used in Portland cement and mortars. Civil engineering appliions are recycled principally through the recycling of construction materials. Therefore we can reasonably use the figures of the recycling of construction and demolition waste which is estimated to be around 50%.
