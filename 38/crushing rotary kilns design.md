 · Lime kilns are very sensitive to the feed size of limestone. To ensure uniform calcination the ratio of the largest to the smallest stone is limited to 2 − 2.5 in the case of vertical kilns (both single shaft and PFR kilns). It is slightly higher for rotary kilns where the ratio can be up to 4. Stone size limitation is an important factor that
