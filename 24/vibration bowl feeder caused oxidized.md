 · In order to make the parts move the vibration must be focused in the desired direction. This is done by mounting the springs on an angle rather than vertically. As the feeder bowl rotates back and forth on its springs the angle causes it to move vertically as well. As it moves forward and up friction pushes the part forward.

## Fundamentals of Vibration 
Vibration and vibration isolation are both intimately connected with the phenomenon of resonance and simple harmonic motion. Simple Harmonic Motion. External force either from a one-time impulse or from a periodic force such as vibration will cause the system to resonate as the spring alternately stores and imparts energy to the moving mass.
