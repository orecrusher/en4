Jaw and gyratory crushers are used for initial size reduction to convert big rocks into small stones. This is generally followed by a cone crusher. A combination of rod mill and ball mills are then used if the ore must be ground below 325 mesh (45 μm). Instead of grinding the ore dry slurry is used as feed for rod or ball mills to avoid dusting.
