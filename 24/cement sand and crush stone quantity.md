 · If you are measuring dry sand reduce the quantity of each batch by 20–25 percent. You will also need to add more water to compensate for the lack of water in the sand. The recommended ratios are based on the use of either 19 mm or 132 mm commercial crushed concrete stone. Stone does not bulk in volume when it gets wet and so no correction

From technical point of view the rich mixes may lead to high shrinkage and cracking in the structural concrete and to evolution of high heat of hydration in mass concrete which may cause cracking. In this study we have used grit and crushed sand for the design mix and found the characteristic compressive strength at 37 and 28 days respectively.
