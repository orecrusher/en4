 · Firing is the process of bringing clay and glazes up to a high temperature. The final aim is to heat the object to the point that the clay and glazes are "mature"—that is that they have reached their optimal level of melting. To the human eye pots and other clay objects do not look melted; the melting that occurs is on the molecular level.
