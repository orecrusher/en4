## Production of Ferro
 · Ferro-manganese (Fe-Mn) is an important additive used as a deoxidizer in the production of steel. It is a master alloy of iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) with a minimum Mn content of 65 % and maximum Mn content of 95 %. It is produced by heating a mixture of the oxides of Mn (MnO2) and iron (Fe2O3) with carbon (C) normally as coke or coal.
