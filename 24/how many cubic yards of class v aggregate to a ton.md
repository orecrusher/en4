## How do I determine how many tons 15 yards of top soil is 
Since there are 2000 pounds in a ton this is 2700.2000 = 1.35 tons per cubic yard and thus 15 cubic yards weighs 1.35 × 15 = 20.25 tons. This may give you a rough idea for a comparison of the costs from the two companies but you should probably call the second company and ask them how much it will cost for 15 yards of topsoil. Penny

## Calculating Cubic Yards vs. Tons 
 · A "/" sign means 'per' so 1.5 TONS/CY reads 1.5 TONS per Cubic yard which simply means there are 1.5 tons per (for) every cubic yard of material. Fortunately a cubic yard of material has a conversion factor (unit weight) so a cubic yard can easily be converted to a ton or vice versa. Here in Southern Maine the following unit weights can be used for rough conversion calculation:
