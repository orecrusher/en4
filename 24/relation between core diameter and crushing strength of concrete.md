## Comparison of cube strength and cylinder strength 
A comparison between cube and cylinder strength of the concrete is required to know to get them an idea about the characteristics strengths to be used in different standards. For example Eurocode uses the characteristic cylinder strength to represent the strength of the concrete.

## Compressive Strength of Concrete and Concrete Testing 
Concrete cube testing or cylinder testing is done to check the development of the strength of the concrete. In other words we test the concrete to check whether it has reached or developed beyond the characteristic strength of concrete assume in the design. Based on the test results conformity can be checked as per the relevant standards.
