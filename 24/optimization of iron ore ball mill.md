A stamp mill consists of a set of heavy steel (iron-shod wood in some cases) stamps loosely held vertically in a frame in which the stamps can slide up and down. They are lifted by cams on a horizontal rotating shaft.As the cam moves from under the stamp the stamp falls onto the ore below crushing the rock and the lifting process is repeated at the next pass of the cam.

## Optimization of Solids Concentration in Iron Ore Ball 
Important advances have been made in the last 60 years or so in the modeling of ball mills using mathematical formulas and models. One approach that has gained popularity is the population balance model in particular when coupled to the specific breakage rate function. The paper demonstrates the appliion of this methodology to optimize solids concentration in ball milling of an iron ore
