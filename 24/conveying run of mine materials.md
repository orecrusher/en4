## Conveying Run Of Mine Materials
Conveying Run Of Mine Materials. Conveying bulk materials with extremely high temperatures of up to 800 C or in environments with extremely low temperatures of up to 60 C puts man and machine under great stress. This is where maximum temperature resistance is required to ensure material e.g. iron ore pellets does not burn through the conveyor.
