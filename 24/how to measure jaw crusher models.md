## Jaw Crushers 
Jaw Crushers are sized by the top opening of the crushing chamber. For example a 32 x 54 Jaw Crusher measures 32" from jaw die to jaw die at the top opening or gape opening and 54" across the width of the two jaw dies. The narrower bottom opening of the crushing chamber is used to size the discharge material.

## Assessing the energy efficiency of a jaw crusher
With a lab-scale jaw crusher as a test case an optimisation was made on how to operate it most energy-efficiently by using an evolutionary algorithm numerical method. For a selected optimised case an attempt was made to simulate the jaw crusher using a commercial software for discrete element modelling (DEM) after first simulating single particle breakage using this software.
