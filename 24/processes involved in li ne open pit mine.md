1.1.3.1 Open-pit mining Open-pit mining is a type of strip mining in which the ore deposit extends very deep in the ground necessitating the removal of layer upon layer of overburden and ore. In many cases logging of trees and clear-cutting or burning of vegetation above the ore deposit may precede removal of the overburden. The

## Opening New Mines 
Opening a new mine is an expensive time-intensive process. Most mines must operate for years to cover initial start-up costs; therefore they are only opened after careful market analysis. In the case of the rare earth elements (REEs) there has only recently been a significant increase in REE usage and the mining industry has not yet increased production to meet this demand.
