## Tips to maximize crushing efficiency 
 · Jaw crushers are routinely choke fed as this maximizes production capacity and ensures particles are uniformly broken. This promotes stone-on-stone crushing breaking up flaky or slabby particles. If you seek fewer fines trickle feeding material into the jaw crusher could achieve this.
