## How Much of Each Energy Source Does It Take to Power Your 
 · Coal. To power one 100 watt bulb for a year would take 325 kg of coal. A light bulb uses 876 kWh of energy per year. In a coal-fired power generator only 40% of coal's thermal energy is converted to electricity. There is 2460 kWh of electricity generated per ton of coal.

## Coal
Preparation of the Fuel The coal that goes to a typical coal-fired power plant has minimal processing. It is crushed to approximately 5 cm in size before it is loaded into the inlet hopper. Coal contains many impurities. Coal in the midwest typically contains a lot of sulfur. The pyritic sulfur from the mineral FeS is relatively easy to remove.
