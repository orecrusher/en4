## Separating Minerals by Floatation 
Copper processing example A high pH is important in the processing of copper ore to maximize this mineral's floatation properties. Most copper ore slurries tend to be acidic. Plants typically add lime to the slurry in the mill or floatation circuit increasing its alkalinity. A typical copper operation contains many floatation cells often
