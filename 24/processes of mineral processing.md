## Digestion of Vitamins Minerals 
All minerals are stored in your body but only some vitamins actually stay in your body. Vitamins are broken up into two egories: fat soluble such as A D E or K and water soluble including all of the B vitamins and vitamin C. Fat-soluble vitamins stay in your body whereas water-soluble vitamins are absorbed immediately with any excess being excreted in urine.

## Introduction to Mineral Processing 
In broader terms mineral processing consists of two functions. Firstly it involves the preparation and liberation of the valuable minerals from waste minerals and secondly the separation these values into two or more products called concentrates. The term separation in this case is synonymous with concentration. These functions are carried out within the constraints of the following three rules.

## Introduction to Mineral Processing or Beneficiation
 · In broader terms mineral processing consists of two functions. Firstly it involves the preparation and liberation of the valuable minerals from waste minerals and secondly the separation these values into two or more products called concentrates. The term separation in this case is synonymous with concentration.
