The coal formation process involves the burial of peat which is made of partly decayed plant materials deep underground. The heat and pressure of burial alters the texture and increases the carbon content of the peat which transforms it into coal a type of sedimentary rock. This process takes millions of years. Types or "ranks" of coal are determined by carbon content.

## Pollution from Mining 
Sub-surface mining frequently goes below the water table so water must be constantly pumped from the mine. Acid mine drainage results from the outflow of water from metal mines coal mines or other areas in which the ground has been disturbed. Metal salts such as Fe +2 are oxidized upon contact with air to more highly acidic aquo species.

## Coal Types Formation and Methods of Mining 
Types of underground mines–shaft mines slope mines and drift mines. The decision of what type of mine to construct depends on the depth of the coal seam and the surrounding terrain. Drift mines have horizontal entries into the coal seam from a hillside. Slope mines which usually are not very deep are inclined from the surface to the coal seam.

A. Abutment - In coal mining (1) the weight of the rocks above a narrow roadway is transferred to the solid coal along the sides which act as abutments of the arch of strata spanning the roadway; and (2) the weight of the rocks over a longwall face is transferred to the front abutment that is the solid coal ahead of the face and the back abutment that is the settled packs behind the face.

## What is coal where is it found? 
Coal is a fossil fuel formed from vegetation which has been consolidated between other rock strata and altered by the combined effects of pressure and heat over millions of years to form coal seams. The energy we get from coal today comes from the energy that plants absorbed from the sun millions of years ago. Types of coal.
