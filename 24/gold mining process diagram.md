## Cyanide Leaching Of Gold 
Gold Cyanide Solution (Leaching Gold With Cyanide) Since the 1890's cyanide has been used to recover gold from gold bearing ores. And today over 115 years later most of the worlds gold is recovered with cyanide playing a large part in the beneficiation of the yellow precious metal.

## On the volatilisation and decomposition of cyanide 
 · 1. Introduction. About 90% of the world's gold mining workforce is represented by artisanal and small-scale gold miners producing around 15% of the world's gold ().In Colombia there are about 200000 artisanal gold miners using mainly mercury for the gold processing (Cordy et al. 2011).The amalgamation process suffers a low capability of mercury recovering.

 · The process produces gold of up 99.5% purity. A repeat of the process may further improve the purity of gold produced by this method. Gold smelting is an important process in the production of gold. It enables gold miners to separate impurity materials from pure gold that is desirable in the market. Smelting often produces gold to the purity

## Extracting Gold 
To isolate pure gold mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.
