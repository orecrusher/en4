## Precious Metal Refining Process 
Gold Refining. Gold mines process ore using various techniques to produce an alloy composed primarily of gold and silver which is called a dore bar. The composition of dore can vary significantly between mines but generally the gold dore bars the Perth Mint processes are composed of between 70-80% gold and 10-15% silver.

 · Marble processing is a fascinating art. From the quarry and until they are loaded onto containers ready for shipment marble slabs go through different transformation phases. Depending on the needs each block of marble is cut in slabs or as per the required measures in order to build staircases or to be used in flooring wall tiling etc.

Once the process is complete the remaining liquid metal is at least 98% pure gold. This is cast into anodes and electrolytically refined by submerging into a gold-based solution. During this process fine or 24k gold is plated onto the hode. Both platinum and palladium remain in the electrolyte solution where they are later recovered.
