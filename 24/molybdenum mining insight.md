## Molybdenum 
Molybdenum was discovered by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1778 and was isolated and named by Peter Jacob Hjelm in 1781. The most important ore source of molybdenum is the mineral molybdenite; a minor amount is recovered from the mineral wulfenite. Molybdenum commonly is recovered as a by-product or co-product from copper mining.
