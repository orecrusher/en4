## Magnetite: South Australia's potential
Magnetite ores require varying degrees of processing and beneficiation to produce an iron ore suitable for steelmaking purposes ultimately contributing to higher production costs. Magnetite concentrates typically range between 65 to 70% Fe and are increasingly being sought as a preferred feedstock for steelmaking particularly those concentrates with low impurities.
