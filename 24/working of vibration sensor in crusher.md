 · Figure 5 provides an example of an actual MEMS vibration sensor which samples at 20480 samples per second (SPS) and starts with 512-point records. In this case the sensor only provides the magnitude information so the total number of bins is 256 and the bin width is equal to 40 Hz (20480/512). Figure 5. ADIS16228 FFT output.

## Measuring Vibration with Accelerometers 
 · Vibration is most commonly measured using a ceramic piezoelectric sensor or accelerometer. An accelerometer is a sensor that measures the dynamic acceleration of a physical device as a voltage. Accelerometers are full-contact transducers typically mounted directly on high-frequency elements such as rolling-element bearings gearboxes or spinning blades.

## What is a Vibration Sensor? 
 · Next let's talk about a strain gauge type of vibration sensor. Just like it sounds a strain gauge measures the strain on a machine component. A strain gauge is a sensor whose resistance varies with applied force; It converts force pressure tension weight etc. into a change in electrical resistance which can then be measured.
