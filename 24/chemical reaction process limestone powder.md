 · "Hard" water contains dissolved mineral compounds including calcium and magnesium and the softening process removes them. It might seem counterintuitive to add calcium to water in order to remove calcium from water but the process uses chemical reactions in a high-pH environment to form calcium compounds that precipitate into solids which can then be filtered out.
