## Moly Grease vs. Lithium: What's the Big Deal?
Moly is used because it sticks to other materials and helps protect bearings that are not lubried consistently. With automatic lubriion there may not be the same need for Moly because every bearing will receive the grease it requires to keep it lubried and purged of contaminants.

Molybdenum was discovered by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1778 and was isolated and named by Peter Jacob Hjelm in 1781. The most important ore source of molybdenum is the mineral molybdenite a minor amount is recovered from the mineral wulfenite. Molybdenum commonly is recovered as a byproduct or coproduct from copper mining.

Copper might turn up as a by-product of a molybdenum mining operation. In the United States about two-thirds of the molybdenum is used to make stainless and alloy steel. Stainless steel resistant to rust and corrosion is used for example in water distribution systems and food-service equipment.Durable alloy steels are used in the formation of automotive parts and construction machinery.

 · Although molybdenum was discovered in the late 18th century it was used early before its discovery. For example in the 14th century Japan used a molybdenum-containing steel to make a saber. In the 16th century molybdenite was used as graphite because it was similar to the appearance and properties of lead galena and graphite.

Molybdenite forms in two distinct crystal polytypes: Molybdenite-2H and Molybdenite-3R.

## Molybdenum Element Facts 
Discovery of Molybdenum. Molybdenite also known as molybdena is a soft black mineral that was once used to make pencils. The mineral was often confused for graphite and it was thought to contain lead.It is now known to be molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2).. In 1778 Swedish scientist Carl W. Scheele proved that molybdenite was not graphite nor did it contain lead.

## The Metal Profile for Molybdenum 
 · Molybdenum is most often produced as a by- or co-product of copper but a few mines do produce moly as a primary product. Primary production of molybdenum is exclusively extracted from molybdenite a sulfide ore which has a molybdenum content of between 0.01 and 0.25%.
