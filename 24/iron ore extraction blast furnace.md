 · The blast furnace Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

Extraction of Metals. Extraction of Iron.. Iron is extracted from its ore in the blast furnace.. The main iron ore is called haematite. Haematite is iron(III) oxide - Fe 2 O 3. The iron ore contains impurities mainly silica (silicon dioxide). Limestone (calcium carbonate) is added to the iron ore which reacts with the silica to form molten calcium silie in the blast furnace.

## How Is Iron Extracted In Blast Furnace? 
Answer (1 of 4): The ore obtained after mining contains iron in the form of iron oxide. Pure iron is obtained therefore by the reduction of this ore. This process is carried out in the blast furnace. Temperature is different at different heights in the furnace. Mixture of iron ore lime stone and coke is introduced the furnace from the top and a blast of burning gases is blown with pressure

## Metal extraction 
The blast furnace. The iron ore coke and limestone ("charge") is fed into the blast furnace from the top. Once inside the hot furnace the coke reacts with the blast of air (containing oxygen) making carbon monoxide gas. This gas is very reactive and has a great desire for more oxygen which it finds in the iron ore.
