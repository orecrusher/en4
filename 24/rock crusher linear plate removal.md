## Crusher 
The jaw crusher reduces the size of large rocks by dropping them into a "V"-shaped mouth at the top of the crusher chamber. This is created between one fixed rigid jaw and a pivoting swing jaw set at acute angles to each other. Compression is created by forcing the rock against the stationary plate in the crushing chamber as shown in Fig. 13.9.

Also remove dirt and debris from crusher frame surfaces and from areas around the machine.
