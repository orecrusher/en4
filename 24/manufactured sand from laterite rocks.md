Abstract: In this study the adaptation of A. thiooxidans to heavy metals leached from saprolitic Ni laterite ores was performed by gradual acclimatisation. The bacteria was cultivated in heavy metals (Ni Co Fe Mg Cr and Mn) with total concentrations of 2400 to 24000 ppm equivalent to total dissolution of 1 to 10% (w/v) pulp densities of the saprolitic Ni laterite ore.
