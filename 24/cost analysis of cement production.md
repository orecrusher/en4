In Adeloye [11] the unit cost of fuel component for cement production is as low as $6 per tonne in China as opposed to $30 per tonne in Nigeria; this has contributed largely to the high and persistent rise in unit cost of ce- ment production. There is thus the need for the adoption of energy efficiency in cement production in Nigeria.
