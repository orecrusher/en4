## Dry and Wet Screening in Mining: What are the Differences 
 · If you think the differences between dry and wet screen mining are limited to the presence or lack of water then you're missing several important points. First of all wet separation technology requires additional equipment including the spray nozzles that funnel the water. Extra plant capital is on the agenda when these additional stages enter the equipment line.
