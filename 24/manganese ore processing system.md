## A Case Study ofthe Production ofHigh
ficiating manganese ores by means of an agglomeration process were started in the 1970's. These investigations resulted in Ihe erection of a 500 ktla sinter plant at Samancor's Mamatwan manganese mjne in 1987. This plant initially produced a 44 per cent manganese sinter from a feed of 38 per cent carbonaceous manganese are.

## Manganese Mining and Processing for Investors Explained 
Pure Manganese used for the production of iron-free alloys is produced by leaching manganese ore with sulfuric acid and a subsequent electrowinning process. The treatment of the Manganese ore should be designed to produce a maximum amount of the Manganese in a coarse form which will be marketable without the further and high cost of nodulizing or sintering.
