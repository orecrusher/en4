A ball mill is a drum-grinding unit where balls from solid materials (steel iron hard alloys ceramics etc) are used. Most common are ball mills where when the drum rotates and the balls rub against the inner walls the balls are lifted until the lifting angle becomes bigger than the angle of repose. Then the grinding media are again below.

The effects of percent solids mill loading and grinding time on product size distribution and ball wear were studied in a laboratory ball mill for a taconite ore. Mild steel balls and HCLA steel balls were used to examine the role that ball hardness play in grinding. Net production of −44-µm (−325-mesh) material reached maximum at 70% solids whereas the ball wear decreased as pulp
