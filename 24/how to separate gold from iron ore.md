## How Minecraft's Cave Update Changes Iron Gold Ore 
 · The biggest change to Minecraft's iron and gold ores is that they will no longer drop ore blocks when mined with a pickaxe that doesn't have Silk Touch. Instead iron and gold ores will now drop new materials called Raw Iron and Raw Gold. These will drop from the ores similar to how coal Redstone and diamonds drop from their respective ores.

## Iron Ore – Official Minecraft Wiki
Iron ore can generate in the Overworld in the form of blobs. Iron ore attempts to generate 20 times per chunk in blobs of size 0-13 from levels 0 to 63 in all biomes. On average they generate 112 ores per chunk. Iron ore can replace stone granite diorite andesite tuff and deepslate. If it replaces tuff or deepslate it will become

If the ore product contains a combination of coarse and fine free gold the modular Gravity Flotation Intensive Leach (GFIL) system can produce a higher-yield product. For ores smaller than 50 micron the particle weight is too light for physical separation by gravity; therefore gold recovery will require a modular chemical flotation process.

Electromagnetic separation – This method is based on the magnetic properties of the metal particles and gauge particles. Powdered ore is placed on the roller belt which is a magnetic belt. So the magnetic material gets attracted towards the belt and stays on that and thus gets separated. Generally it is used for iron and manganese ores.

## How Gold Is Refined: A Step
It's still just raw ore that requires processing before it becomes pure gold. First the ore is crushed. It then undergoes a series of processes that will vary depending on the different elements and minerals that are mixed in with the gold ore. The purpose of these procedures is to separate the gold from these surrounding elements.

## Extracting Gold 
Removing the gold-bearing rock from the ground is just the first step. To isolate pure gold mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel.

## How is iron extracted from its ore? – The Geek City – Your 
Iron is extracted from the ore containing the maximum amount of iron. This is found near the surface of the Earth. Iron ore is converted to iron by various processes. The most common process is the use of a blast furnace to extract pig iron. Pig iron comprises of about 92-94% iron and about 3-5% of carbon along with other impurities.

## Here Is The Correct Way To Effectively Recognize Gold Ore
 · Gold can be bright yellow. But when more silver is mixed in it can appear whitish. Most of the gold found by miners is taken from gold ore not nuggets or flakes. The ore is usually brown a metallic iron color or mixed with a large white quartz rock that has very little gold in it. Gold ore may not be easily recognizable to the untrained eye.

## Smelting and Roasting Ores to recover gold silver and 
The process works best when the ore is crushed to small pieces before roasting. Additives such as common rock salt are often added to the mix before it is heated to enhance the reaction of the sulfides. Once the ores are fully roasted and the sulfur is driven off the extraction of the gold or silver from the ore is not especially difficult.
