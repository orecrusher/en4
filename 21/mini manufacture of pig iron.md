## Creating Steel 
Another way to create steel from pig iron is the Bessemer process which involves the oxidation of the impurities in the pig iron by blowing air through the molten iron in a Bessemer converter.The heat of oxidation raises the temperature and keeps the iron molten. As the air passes through the molten pig iron impurities unite with the oxygen to form oxides.

## Pig iron 
Pig Iron Production - Blast Furnace Route. More than 1.1 billion tonnes of blast furnace iron was produced globally in 2016. Blast furnace economics are such that larger units have lower unit production costs hence there has been a trend to bigger and bigger furnaces. Modern blast furnaces produce more than 10000 tonnes per day.

DRI production. Direct reduction of iron is the removal of oxygen from iron ore or other iron bearing materials in the solid state i.e. without melting as in the blast furnace. The reducing agents are carbon monoxide and hydrogen coming from reformed natural gas syngas or coal. Iron ore is used mostly in pellet and/or lumpy form.

## Carbon2Chem 
We can use a large amount of the CO 2 from steelmaking in chemical production meaning that the harmful gas is no longer emitted into the air. Carbon dioxide is an unavoidable byproduct of pig iron production. In chemical terms iron ore – the starting material for steel – is an iron oxide i.e. a compound of iron and oxygen.

The first blast furnaces appeared in the 14th century and produced one ton per day. Even though equipment is improved and higher production rates can be achieved the processes inside the blast furnace remain the same. The blast furnace uses coke iron ore and limestone to produce pig iron. Coal is a key part of the coke-making process.
