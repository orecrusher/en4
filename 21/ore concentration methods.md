 · Simple concentration methods reduce the amount of mercury required for amalgamation to roughly 1 part mercury per 1 part of gold recovered. A vast improvement. Better yet almost all of the mercury that is applied to a good concentrate ends up in the gold-mercury amalgam and if this mercury is recycled for example by using a retort losses can be further decreased by an additional 95%.

## Ores and Minerals 
First ores are crushed and grinded and then gauge or matrix is removed from the powdered ore. This is called concentration of ores. Ores of highly moderately and low reactive metals are 1 st concentrated. This step is common for ores of all types of metals. It is carried out by various methods depending upon the nature of the ore.

## The method used for the concentration of sulphide ores is:
Answer. Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic. The principle of froth flotation process is that sulphide ores are preferentially wetted by the pine oil whereas the gangue particles are wetted by the water. Hence the method used for the concentration of sulphide ores is froth flotation.

16.2.2 Concentration or Dressing of the Ore Generally the ores are found mixed with earthy impurities like sand clay lime stone etc. These unwanted impurities in the ore are called gangue or matrix. The process of removal of gangue from powdered ore is called concentration or ore dressing. There are several methods for concentrating the ores.

## Ore Dressing Methods 
 · Ore-dressing methods fall naturally into two general subdivisions— (1) concentration methods and (2) direct-recovery methods (amalgamation and leaching or wet methods). Concentration methods are employed to remove worthless gangue material and concentrate the valuable minerals of the crude ore in a smaller bulk.
