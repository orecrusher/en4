As the comminution performance depends on the grinding load (which is different for vertical roller mills in comparison to ball mills) the sample characterization must be adapted as well. For the Zeisel and Hardgrove grindability tests the feed sample with its precisely defined particle size is crushed by pressure and friction between a grinding bowl and grinding balls.

BOND ROD MILL GRINDABILITY The Bond rod mill grindability test is performed similarly to the ball mill test. The feed sample is stage-crushed to ½" (12.5mm) and the test is run under a 100% circulating load. The test can also be closed with various sieve sizes but for AG/SAG mill analyses the standard 14-mesh (1.18mm) sieve is typically used.
