## How gold is made 
Gold recognizable by its yellowish cast is one of the oldest metals used by humans. As far back as the Neolithic period humans have collected gold from stream beds and the actual mining of gold can be traced as far back as 3500 B.C. when early Egyptians (the Sumerian culture of Mesopotamia) used mined gold to craft elaborate jewelry religious artifacts and utensils such as goblets.

## Gold Cyanidation Process 
 · Generally a residual strength of 0.05% CaO will indie a suitable quantity of lime for an all-gold ore and 0.1% for a silver or silver-gold ore. To obtain the amount of lime needed in terms of pure calcium oxide (CaO) the strength of the lime used for the test maybe ascertained closely by putting one gram in a litre of distilled water and agitating in a bottle for 8 or 10 hours.
