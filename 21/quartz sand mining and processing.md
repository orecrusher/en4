Rehabilitation is a continuous process and can start as soon as the excavated material is returned to the start of the mine pit. Topsoil is replaced and vegetation cover re-seeded or replanted. Heavy mineral sands are separated from the light sands (mostly quartz and clay) by using gravity processing methods through simple spirals or classifiers.

## Describe the black impurity in quartz sand 
The color of pure quartz sand is generally white opaque or semi transparent or transparent but we will also see black impurities other than quartz in quartz sand. These black impurities cannot be completely removed in the pickling process of quartz sand. If there are too many black impurities the quality of finished quartz sand will be affected.
