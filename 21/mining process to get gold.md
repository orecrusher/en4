## The Gold Smelting Process 
 · Gold miners have to smelt their gold in order to remove impurities resulting in pure gold. Most large scale gold miners send their ore to smelters with large equipment for the smelting process. Small scale miners still can do their own smelting using specialized kilns. Many people confuse gold smelting with melting.

The process works best when the ore is crushed to small pieces before roasting. Additives such as common rock salt are often added to the mix before it is heated to enhance the reaction of the sulfides. Once the ores are fully roasted and the sulfur is driven off the extraction of the gold or silver from the ore is not especially difficult.

## What are the main methods of mining? 
There are four main mining methods: underground open surface (pit) placer and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits. Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits. Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels beach sands or other environments.
