## Machined Graphite 
Graphite materials are used in a range of aerospace appliions. Not only is graphite the smart choice in terms of quality but our graphite is also the greener choice. With aerospace being a growing industry dependent on fossil fuels organisations have a responsibility to reduce the environmental impact of their industrial processes.
