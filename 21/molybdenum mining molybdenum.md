## Machining Molybdenum
Wrought molybdenum is comparable to stainless steel under various machining mechanisms and moly can be machined with conventional machine shop equipment. However molybdenum is unique in relation to medium hard cast iron or cold rolled steel in that dull cutting tools cause the edges to break out during molybdenum machining operations.

Molybdenum was discovered by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1778 and was isolated and named by Peter Jacob Hjelm in 1781. The most important ore source of molybdenum is the mineral molybdenite; a minor amount is recovered from the mineral wulfenite. Molybdenum commonly is recovered as a by-product or co-product from copper mining.
