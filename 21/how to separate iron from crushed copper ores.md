## extraction of metals 
 · Some copper ores can be converted into copper(II) sulphate solution by leaving the crushed ore in contact with dilute sulphuric acid for a long time. Copper can then be extracted from the copper(II) sulphate solution. But in many cases it is possible to separate the metal compound from unwanted rocky material by physical means.

## A Look at the Process of Pelletizing Iron Ore for Steel 
Iron ore must go through a lengthy pre-processing stage before it can be pelletized – a series of steps that work to beneficiate and concentrate low-grade ores. This process varies depending on the ore source but typically involves various stages of crushing and grinding to reduce the size of the iron ore.

 · You can remove the most common metals found in gold ore (copper zinc and lead) using elements that bond with oxygen at lower temperatures than gold. This oxidation process will make copper oxide zinc oxide and lead oxide — all of which are less dense than pure gold and will float to the top of your crucible allowing the slag to be sloughed off.
