When conveying dry bulk materials pneumatically the system designer has to also decide if the system is going to be a pressure system or a vacuum system. There are valid reasons to do each. Pressure systems are often more efficient offering higher possible absolute pressure limits than vacuum systems in a given line size with a given type of air moving device.

From David Mills 'Pneumatic conveying system design guide' the solid loading ratio (ɸ) is 0.5. Therefore ṁ = ρ × A × v = 8000 Kg/hr = 2.2 Kg/s Were ρ is the density of the mixture A is the area of cross-section of the pipe and v is the velocity of discharge.

 · All of the above criteria is designed and selected by using the standard design calculations from the 'Pneumatic conveying system design guide' by David Mills. Thus for design calculations mainly two aspects about pneumatic conveying are used and for example it could be conveyed in dilute phase or dense phase.

## SIZING A PNEUMATIC CONVEYING SYSTEM
As a general rule in pneumatic conveying when sizing a system we look primarily at pressures velocities and line loadings to determine best what the line size should be. For example a well sized dilute phase pressure system going 200 feet would probably run somewhere between 6-12 PSIG have a terminal velocity of between 4500 – 6000 fpm
