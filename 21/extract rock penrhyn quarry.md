Penrhyn Quarry has been producing roofing slate since the thirteenth-century. From these sources Welsh slate has been used and crafted by many generations of people from all walks of life from the Iron Age to present day. The earliest records of slate used in North Wales are from the Roman fort at Seqontium Caernarfon circa 77AD.
