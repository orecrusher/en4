 · Coal is loaded into the ovens and heated in the absence of oxygen up to temperatures around 1100 degrees Celsius (2000 degrees Fahrenheit). Without oxygen the coal does not burn. Instead it begins to melt. The high temperatures volatilize unwanted impurities such as hydrogen oxygen nitrogen and sulfur.

Coal is the dirtiest of the fossil fuels and responsible for over 0.3C of the 1C increase in global average temperatures – making it

## Energy Fossil Fuels and the Carbon Cycle
plants was stored as potential energy in coal. Today when the coal is burned its chemical potential energy is changed into heat energy a form of kinetic energy. The general chemical reaction for this process is: Carbon (C) + Oxygen (O 2) Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) + Energy (Heat) Just as energy is conserved in the above reaction so is matter.

 · See below. Coal burning generates thermic energy (heat) and luminous energy (light). The luminous energy is wasted but the the heat is used to boil a liquid. This liquid gets heated becomes a gas and start floating upwards (kinetic energy - movement) moving a fan strategically placed along the way. This fan moves magnets and a change in the magnetic field creates current thus changing that

## Coal
Coal-fired boilers are mainly operated at either subcritical or supercritical conditions. From a thermo-physics perspective two phase mixtures of water and steam are replaced by a single supercritical fluid when the boiler pressure increases above the critical pressure of 22.12 MPa and the corresponding saturation temperature of 374 °C (Shen and Cheng 2004).
