## Trade – Coal 2020 – Analysis 
Low coal prices in mid-2020 combined with recovering fuel prices and high labour costs mean that many thermal coal mines in Australia have been operating at a loss. High fixed costs of mine operation and take-or-pay contracts for the use of rail and port infrastructure cause most producers to continue operations as long as the value of take-or-pay costs are higher than losses in production.
