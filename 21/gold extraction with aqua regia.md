In Aqua Regia the Nitrate ions serves as an oxidizer where the Chloride ions act as sort of "receptors" and accommodate the oxidized metals. Again this is an over simplified explanation but is enough for us to conclude that excess of HCl in AR does absolutely no harm where an excess of nitric acid/nitrate salt will hinder any reduction attempts (i.e. Precipitation of Gold metal).
