## Ball Mills 
The ball milling process is carried out for approximately 100–150 h to obtain uniform-sized fine powder. In high-energy ball milling vacuum or a specific gaseous atmosphere is maintained inside the chamber. High-energy mills are classified into attrition ball mills planetary ball mills vibrating ball mills and low-energy tumbling mills.
