 · The densities of rocks and minerals are normally expressed as specific gravity which is the density of the rock relative to the density of water. This isn't as complex as you may think because water's density is 1 gram per cubic centimeter or 1 g/cm 3. Therefore these numbers translate directly to g/cm 3 or tonnes per cubic meter (t/m 3).

## Fine Aggregate: Definition Size Density and Properties 
Fine aggregate is the essential ingredient in concrete that consists of natural sand or crushed stone. The quality and fine aggregate density strongly influence the hardened properties of the concrete.. The concrete or mortar mixture can be made more durable stronger and cheaper if you made the selection of fine aggregate on basis of grading zone particle shape and surface texture abrasion

Coarse-grained soils have 50% or less material passing the No. 200 sieve. Fine-grained soils have 50% or more material passing the No. 200 sieve. Engineering properties such as strength and compressibility of coarse-grained soil are governed by the grain-size of the particles and their structural arrangement.

There are 12 classes of soil texture. For example if most particles are large and coarse the soil is called a sand. It looks and feels sandy. A silt soil is dominated by medium-sized particles and feels like flour. Small-sized soil particles primarily make up a clay soil which feels slippery or greasy when wet.
