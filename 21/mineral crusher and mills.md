## Grinding 
The ball mill is the fine grinding machine connect the SAG or AG mill and flotation machine. Ball mills produce fine particles with a uniform size for flotation its grinding medias commonly are steel ball. The ball mill rolls grinding media together with the ore as the ore grinds these balls initially 5-10 cm in diameter but gradually wear out.

## Crushing Mineral Processing
 · In mineral processing the reduction of minerals by crushing and grinding may be regarded as having one or other of two main objectives: the attainment of a size appropriate for the direct industrial appliion of the mineral e.g. barytes sand aggregate; or the release of metallic or ore inclusions from an unwanted matrix with a view to maximum separation.
