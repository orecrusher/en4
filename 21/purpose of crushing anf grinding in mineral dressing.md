Shaking tables are rectangular-shaped tables with riffled decks across which a film of water flows. The mechanical drive imparts motion along the long axis of the table perpendicular to the flow of the water.

## What is Grinding? 
 · For example through crushing the mineral ore to below a certain size and finishing by grinding it into powder the ultimate fineness depends on the fineness of dissemination of the desired mineral. Grinding can be done wet or dry depending on the process in use but for dry grinding the materials first may need to be dried in cylindrical rotary dryers.
