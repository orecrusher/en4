## CNC Milling: Introduction to cutting tools 
Ball nose end mills are used on workpieces with complex surfaces. Choosing flat end mill vs. a ball end mill will determine the characteristics of the tooling marks (or lack thereof) on your model. Most jobs will benefit from strategic use of multiple size and shape tools for milling different features. End Mills are often used for roughing and

## The Skinny on End Mills 
 · Each end mill tip shape is designed for a particular purpose. Some common cutter shapes are ballnose fish tail surface planing v-carving and straight. Ballnose mills produce a rounded pass and are ideal for 3D contour work while fish tail cutters will produce a flat surface.

## What are the Avantages of Milling: Benefit of Vertical and 
 · Basically milling is nothing but the process of removing metals by passing the work-pieces through a rotating multi-point cutter. The machine is able to hold multiple cutters at one point in time and it works at a high speed for faster removal of metal. In fact the metal removal rate for milling machines is faster than the lathe machines.

 · Other features on a part in combination with a tooling ball can be used to extrapolate a plane from a linear feature. To do this on paper or manually takes good geospatial abilities. To do it on CNC machines or with CMM's takes less well-developed geospatial abilities because the computer does a lot of the leg-work for you.

## What is a Sand Mill? 
Others have recapture systems allowing people to pass the mixture through the sand mill again to make it finer and more even. The design works by agitating the sand rather than creating pressure ensuring that the grinding medium does not break apart in the device when it is used properly.

## How Do Ball Valves Work? 
 · A ball valve as its name neatly suggests is any valve that utilizes a ball to control the flow of substances from one opening to the next.The center of the ball includes a port sometimes called a bore. The ball valve is in the open position when this central port is aligned up in the same direction as the connected pipeline as such a positioning allows the fluid or gas to flow through.
