## Studland's sand dunes 
 · Sand began being deposited on the eastern shore of the Studland peninsula only about 500 years ago: the beach we all enjoy is just the seaward edge of a dune system that has been growing ever since. In that time the dunes have formed a barrier that has separated Little Sea a freshwater lake from the sea itself.

## Coastal sand dunes form and function: Pikao (or Pingao 
Sand dunes are formed at the interface between the sea and land. They are formed from sand which is eroded and ground rock derived from terrestrial (e.g. glacial or river) and oceanic sources (e.g. coral reefs). The form of dune systems will be dictated by a number of factors including the shape of the coastline shape of the beach

## Dynamics threats and management of dunes 
Coastal sand dunes are aeolian landforms found along the majority of the world's coast.This ecosystem loed at the spatial transition between terrestrial and marine environments can be found in coastal areas where a supply of sand‐sized material (within the size range 0.2-2.0 mm) is available to be transported by winds. The coastal dune

Coastal Sand Dunes are obviously loed in coastal regions but they are generally found on coasts that experience strong onshore (wind that blows on to the shore from the sea) prevailing winds. For this reason most Coastal Sand Dune ecosystems are found in the world's temperate and arid tropical climatic zones because these areas are more likely to experience onshore prevailing winds.

 · Disadvantages Beach Nourishment - Can kill other wildlife very expensive and has to be repeated. Dune regeneration - limited to small areas and nourishment is expensive. Marsh Creation - Isn't useful where erosion rates are high because marsh can't establish itself. Managed Retreat - people disagree with what land is allowed to flood.

Dune Slack. Sand dunes are separated by dips called dune slacks. Slacks are formed in two ways – either when a new dune ridge forms in front of a low-lying area which cuts it off from the sea or when a dune blowout forms in an area that's got lots of vegetation exposing a dip of bare sand.

 · Sand Collapse. Do not allow children to dig deep holes at the base of dunes. Rarely dune slipfaces may collapse the hole partially trapping a child. Wind and Sand. Check weather forecasts in advance. Sand begins to bounce around when the wind speed reaches 13 mph. Stronger winds create wind-blown sand that can be painful and dangerous.

Dune stabilisation by vegetation is a sustainable protection measure enhancing the natural protection ability of dune areas. It provides some protection against wave and storm surge attack and at the same time it preserves the natural coastal landscape if performed moderately. Dune stabilisation requires a planned and co-ordinated effort.
