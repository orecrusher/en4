## Coal Geology 
Mining. Coal is mined by both surface or 'opencut' (or opencast) and underground or 'deep' mining methods depending on the local geology of the deposit. Underground mining currently accounts for about 60 per cent of world coal production but around 80 per cent of Australia's coal is produced from opencut mines.
