## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining Extraction
The largest copper mine in North America (and the world's largest man-made excavation) is the Bingham Canyon Mine near Salt Lake City Utah. A $1.5 billion modernization program completed in 1998 turned Bingham Canyon into North America's lowest-cost copper producer a model of operational efficiency and environmental compliance.

## Copper: A World Trade in 3000 BC? 
The exact size of the mined ore is perhaps never going to be exactly determined but what is known is that ca. 1200 BC all mining activity was halted. But around 1000 AD mining was restarted and lasted until 1320 AD. During this period a moderate 2000 tons were removed. In North America not even 1% has been recovered.
