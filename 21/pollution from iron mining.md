## Mine water pollution in Scotland: nature extent and 
 · Most of the pollution is due to net-alkaline ferruginous waters emerging from deep mines. Scrutiny of records from 80 deep mine discharges reveals that iron concentrations in these waters are only likely to exceed 20 mg/l and the pH to be below 6.5 where the discharge emerges within 0.5 km of the outcrop of the shallowest mined seam.

## Harmful Effects of Iron Oxides 
 · In mining states like Pennsylvania iron mines flooded with water spill gallons of iron oxide into ponds rivers and lakes; this can poison fish and pollute the environment. The iron molecules react with oxygen to create a solid iron oxide known as "yellow boy" which sinks to the bottom of rivers and waterways to pollute them.
