 · In view of this lithium is usually extracted from its mineral that is found in igneous rocks (chiefly spodumene) and from lithium chloride salts found in brine pools while ignoring other resources including the low-grade ores. The rising demand for lithium for various appliions thus calls for prospecting and processing all viable resources.
