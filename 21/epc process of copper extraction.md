## Copper extraction 
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source local environmental regulations and other factors.. As in all mining operations the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

## Extraction of Copper from Copper pyrite 
The principal ore of copper is copper pyrite and copper is extracted from this ore. The different steps in extraction of copper are: Crushing and Concentration: The ore obtained from mines are broken down into small piece by jaw crusher and then pulverized. The ore being sulphide ore is concentrated by froth floatation process.
