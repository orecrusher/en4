## Ball Mills 
Ball Mills are generally used to grind material 1/4 inch and finer down to the particle size of 20 to 75 microns. To achieve a reasonable efficiency with ball mills they must be operated in a closed system with oversize material continuously being recirculated back into the mill to be reduced. Various classifiers such as screens spiral
