## Molybdenum Ores 
The average molybdenum content in the ores of large deposits ranges from 0.06 to 0.30 percent and in small deposits from 0.5 to 1.0 percent. Molybdenum is extracted as a by-product from other ores where its content is 0.005 percent or more. Molybdenum ores

## Molybdenum Processing 
The milled ore/gangue powder is mixed with a liquid and aerated in the flotation step. The less dense ore rises in the froth to be collected while the gangue sinks to be discarded. Flotation separates the metallic minerals from the gangue this way and – in the case of copper/ molybdenum ores – separates molybdenite from copper sulphide.

## Extraction 
The extraction of molybdenum Molybdenum comes from a sulphide ore called molybdenite. First the ore must be crushed into a powder and then the copper sulphide must be separated from the rest. What is left is molybdenum sulphide and that is roasted.

## How Is Molybdenum Mined and Processed? 
 · Molybdenum calcined sand is dissolved in an alkaline medium (ammonium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide) and impurities are removed by precipitation and filtration and/or solvent extraction. The obtained ammonium molybdate solution is converted into any molybdate product by crystallization or acid precipitation which can be further processed into pure molybdenum trioxide by calcining.
