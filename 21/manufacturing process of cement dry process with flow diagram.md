## Analysis of material flow and consumption in cement 
 · Studies on mass flows associated with the cement manufacturing process are fairly limited and this study intends to fill the "gap." The purpose of this study is to examine the material flow in a typical cement production process to quantify and understand the material flows in each stage and to identify opportunities for more effective material management.
