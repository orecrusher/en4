 · Tropical cyclones forming between 5 and 30 degrees North latitude typically move toward the west. Sometimes the winds in the middle and upper levels of the atmosphere change and steer the cyclone toward the north and northwest. When tropical cyclones reach latitudes near 30 degrees North they often move northeast.

For starters tropical cyclones have a "warm core" meaning that temperatures throughout most of the troposphere are higher at the center of a tropical cyclone compared to its surroundings.

## What is bombogenesis? 
 · Bombogenesis a popular term used by meteorologists occurs when a midlatitude cyclone rapidly intensifies dropping at least 24 millibars over 24 hours. A millibar measures atmospheric pressure. This can happen when a cold air mass collides with a warm air mass such as air over warm ocean waters. The rapidly strengthening weather system is known a bomb cyclone.

It is a region of significant horizontal gradients in temperature or humidity. Typically 100 to 200 km wide – very sharp transitions are uncommon. Fronts are a dominant feature of mid-latitudes.

## Mid
 · A mid-latitude cyclone is a synoptic (large-scale) low pressure system that forms along weather fronts in Earth's mid-latitudes (usually between 30° and 60° latitude from the equator). In the continental U.S. these storms most often occur from late fall

## Comparing Tropical and Mid
As you now know tropical cyclones operate quite a bit differently from mid-latitude cyclone so make sure that you understand the main contrasts between the two types of storms. To help you keep track of the major differences below is a quick summary highlighting the key differences between mid-latitude and tropical cyclones.

## Extratropical cyclone 
An extratropical cyclone (also called a mid-latitude cyclone) is a type of cyclone.It is a large low-pressure weather area with clouds rain and heavy wind.They occur in areas that are between latitudes 30° – 60° from the equator.They are not the same as tropical cyclones or low-pressure weather areas from polar zones. They are actually many masses of cold and warm fronts producing rain

## Mid
Mid-latitude cyclones drive most of the stormy weather in the continental United States. Development of these cyclones often involves a warm front from the south meeting a cold front from the north. In the Northern Hemisphere cyclones move in a counterclockwise direction. (In the Southern Hemisphere cyclones are clockwise.)

 · Typically 100 to 200 km wide – very sharp transitions are uncommon. Fronts are a dominant feature of mid-latitudes. In particular fronts associated with low pressure systems (mid-latitude cyclones extra-tropical cyclones depressions). The movement of fronts is responsible for much of the day- to-day variability in weather conditions.

This is a good point. Only meteorologists appear to use the term MidLatitude Cyclone although it is quite easily understood since these cyclones form in the middle latitudes of earth (30s 40s 50s in latitude). I'd be willing to keep this article name the same for the time being.

 · These storms populate the middle and high latitudes north of 35 degrees latitude in the Northern Hemisphere and thus they also are called "mid-latitude cyclones." If the barometric pressure of a mid-latitude cyclone falls by at least 1 millibar per hour for 24 hours the storm is referred to as a "bomb cyclone."

Mid-Latitude cyclones are also known as extra-tropical or frontal cyclones.These weather systems are named for occurring in the middle latitudes of earth. They are classified as large traveling cyclonic storms up to 2000 kilometers in diameter with centers of low atmospheric pressure.

 · Similar to extreme cyclones both datasets show similar long-term trends in terms of their signs for windstorms over Northern Europe and the North Atlantic. In general there is a better agreement of HFV compared to LFV with mostly positive correlations even if long-term trends differ substantially in sign and/or magnitude.
