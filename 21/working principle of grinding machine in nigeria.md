## How Electron Beam Machining Process Works? 
 · Working Principle. In an electron beam machining the electrons strike the workpiece with a high velocity. As the electron strikes the workpiece the kinetic energy of the electron changes into heat energy. The heat energy so produced is used to melt and vaporize the materials from the w/p. The whole process takes place in vacuum.
