Bauxite is an aluminium ore found in deposits around the world. Once the ore is mined out of the ground the red bauxite rock is crushed and dissolved into a white alumina powder using what is known as the Bayer process. This alumina powder is then smelted into aluminium metal. Australia is the world's largest producers of bauxite.
