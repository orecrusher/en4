Clinker is produced by heating crushed limestone and a mix of other materials (clay and sand) to 1450 °C in a rotary kiln. Clinker is later ground down to a fine powder and mixed with gypsum and other ingredients to make cement. The rotary kiln is the heart of the manufacturing process where raw materials are heated up and decarbonisation of

## How Does Clinker Cooler Reduce 
The main power consumption of a clinker cooler is its cooling fans. It usually takes 1.9-2.3 m 3 under standard conditions to cool 1 kg clinker from 1400 ℃ to 65 ℃ and the power consumption of the whole system is about 7 kWh. If the air consumption per kilogram of clinker cooling is reduced from 2 m 3 to 1.7 m 3 the air consumption efficiency will be 15% lower than that of other cement

 · Though "cement" and "concrete" are often used interchangeably concrete is actually the final product made from cement. The primary component of cement is limestone. To produce cement limestone and other clay-like materials are heated in a kiln at 1400°C and then ground to form a lumpy solid substance called clinker; clinker is then combined with gypsum to form cement.
