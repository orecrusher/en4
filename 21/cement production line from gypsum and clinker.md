## Project Report on CEMENT FROM CLINKER 
Clinker when added with gypsum (to control the setting properties of cement and ensure compressive strength) and ground finely produces cement. Clinker can be stored for long periods of time in a dry condition without degradation of quality hence it is traded internationally and used by cement manufacturers when raw materials are found to be scarce or unavailable.

 · Clinker (in cement industry) is transitional product in cement production. Upon heating mixture obtained from limestone (about 75%) and clay (about 25%) partial melting occurs and clinker granules are formed. Clinker and gypsum (about 5 %) are mixed and finely milled to obtain cement. Gypsum control the setting properties of the cement.

Clinker is a nodular material produced in the kilning stage during the production of cement and is used as the binder in many cement products. The lumps or nodules of clinker are usually of diameter 3-25 mm and dark grey in color. It is produced by heating limestone and clay to the point of liquefaction at about 1400°C-1500°C in the rotary kiln.

## Cement clinker 
Cement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product. Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter. It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilie materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.

Clinker is a granular substance containing spherical pellets of diameter 3-25 mm. Cement is such a fine powdery substance that each pound of cement contains 150 billion grains. 3: Clinker is produced inside the kiln during the cement manufacturing process. Raw mix is heated and then rapidly cooled to produce the marble-sized pellets of clinker.
