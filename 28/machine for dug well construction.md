Construction Features of Dug Wells - US EPA. Dug Wells Dug wells are holes in the ground dug by shovel or backhoe. Historically a dug well was excavated below the groundwater table until incoming water exceeded the digger's bailing rate. The well was then lined (cased) with stones brick tile or other material to prevent collapse.
