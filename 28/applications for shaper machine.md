## What is Shaper Machine? 
 · A shaper machine is one of the types of machine tool which uses the relative motion between the workpiece and the cutting tool. With the help of this linear motion this device machine (cut) in a linear toolpath. Its cut is quite similar to the lathe machine. Lathe gives us a helical cut while the shaper gives us the required linear cut.
