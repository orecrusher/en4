## Iron Ore Smelting Process 
 · At the surface iron ore processing plants the iron ore is put through crushers and ball mills to break it into a uniform and more workable size and then washed with the residue going to tailings. The ore is the transported to the various smelters loed locally or on the other side of the world with large bulk carriers being used to ship the ore by sea.

## Mining and Refining – Process 
Unlike the base metal ores bauxite does not require complex processing because most of the bauxite mined is of an acceptable grade. Ore quality can be improved by relatively simple and inexpensive processes for removing clay known as "beneficiation" which include washing wet screening and mechanical or manual sorting.

Different percentages of iron content reflect both the natural variation in iron ore grades found in mine deposits and the degree of processing (if any) employed to upgrade the ore for a certain use. In general higher purity ores help increase hot metal yields in the blast furnace and also lower production cost by reducing the amount of coke required.
