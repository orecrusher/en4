## Ancient China 
Through the use of coal as carved ear ornaments and the creation of the world's first coal mine China led the pre-modern world in coal use. Ancient China's coal use enabled it to develop into a sophistied economy and society. With the opening of the Fushan mine in northeastern China over 3000 years ago the Chinese took a significant step.

 · Coal ore extraction involves both surface (open-pit) and underground mining techniques. The method selected depends on a variety of factors including the nature and loion of the deposit size depth and grade of the deposit (Norgate and Haque 2010).Surface mining operates in two distinct stages overburden removal and coal extraction as well as the recovery of the mined area.

## Coal mining 
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa a coal mine and its structures are a colliery a coal mine is called a 'pit

First of all the layer of earth – overburden – above the first coal seam has to be removed. (The seam can be up to 200 meters below the surface.) All the earth around the base of the seam is removed before extraction begins. When the hole is large enough the miners dig down to the next layer of coal. Each layer is called a bench.

As more mines close what happens to this land will define the fortunes of the communities that grew around the industry.

The first truly large-scale surface mining operation began in 1962 at Whitewood Mine 74 km (46 mi.) west of Edmonton near Wabamun Lake. The mine subsequently fed the nearby Wabamun thermal electric generating station which had previously operated on natural gas until the power plant was fully retired on March 31 2010.

 · Retreat mining is done at the end of the life of a mine when the coal deposit had been depleted through normal room and pillaring. Normal room and pillar coal mines typically recover 40-45% of the coal loed within the property. Mining the pillars upon retreat from a room and pillar mine allows operators to increase coal recovery to around 60%.

## Box Cut Mining Techniques Underground Mining Mining 
In most mining areas it is box cut that serves as the first step in the excavation process. Outlining a box shape it consists of a single rectangular cut made in the surface of the earth. In general this type of mining technique is used for extracting coal however it is applied to other material types i.e. from metals to minerals.
