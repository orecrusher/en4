## Ore box 
Ore boxes are items that store metal ores. Initially they can store up to 100 of each ore increased by 20 for certain ores at certain Mining levels (see table below). Completing the Everything Is Oresome achievement (90 Mining required boostable) also increases storage by 20 for all ores allowing up to 140 to be stored. These two effects are independent of each other.

## Gold cyanidation 
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction.. Production of reagents for mineral processing to recover gold copper zinc and silver represents

## Smelting and Roasting Ores to recover gold silver and 
The process works best when the ore is crushed to small pieces before roasting. Additives such as common rock salt are often added to the mix before it is heated to enhance the reaction of the sulfides. Once the ores are fully roasted and the sulfur is driven off the extraction of the gold or silver from the ore is not especially difficult.

## Gold in Quartz 
Crushing the ore can free the gold and allow recovery by gravity-based methods. In fact it's very common that the gold in hard rock ores will range in the 30- to 200-mesh size range with most of the gold in the lower end of that range. The tried and true method for testing these ores in the field is hand crushing and panning.
