## Barite Mineral 
Barite Occurrence. Barite often occurs as concretions and void-filling crystals in sediments and sedimentary rocks.It is especially common as concretions and vein fillings in limestone and dolostone.Where these carbonate rock units have been heavily weathered large accumulations of barite are sometimes found at the soil-bedrock contact.

## Brief Outline Geology of Nigeria and Minerals
Nigeria is richly endowed with significant mineral occurrences of high economic potentials. The Paleoproterozoic schist belt is associated with orogenic gold manganese and Alogoma type banded iron formation. The Neoproterozoic Pan-African orogenic cycle culminated with the formation of some mineralized pegmatite fields in Nigeria.
