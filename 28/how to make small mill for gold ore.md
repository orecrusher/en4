## Mill (grinding) 
A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding crushing or cutting. Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them. Historically mills were powered by hand or by animals (e.g. via a hand crank) working animal (e.g. horse mill) wind or water ().

## How Are Metal Prices Determined? 
 · Consequently the difference between bid and offer prices for standard base metals usually is much smaller than what one would see for other metals. Downstream metal prices such as copper wire or powder and upstream raw materials such as copper ore and concentrate can be bought and sold based on prices determined by the market standard.
