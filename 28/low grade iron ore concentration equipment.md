## A Look at the Process of Pelletizing Iron Ore for Steel 
Iron ore must go through a lengthy pre-processing stage before it can be pelletized – a series of steps that work to beneficiate and concentrate low-grade ores. This process varies depending on the ore source but typically involves various stages of crushing and grinding to reduce the size of the iron ore.

## Iron ore pelletizing 
Iron ore can be upgraded to a higher iron ore content through beneficiation This process generates iron ore filter cake which needs to be pelletized to be used in the steel making process. Also during the processing of high grade iron ores which don't need beneficiated fines which are generated can be pelletized and used instead of being disposed of.

## Ore sorting: Efficiently optimise the treatment of ores in 
Use ore sorting equipment to concentrate ores and cut process costs There are many ways of improving recovery processes for a wide variety of ores using sorting equipment. At STEINERT we always take the same approach: sorting waste rock and ore with low concentrations out from the process at an early stage to save energy and resources and to unlock more enriched ore more effectively.

## Processing of low grade iron ore from Singhbhum
Processing of low grade hematitic iron ores is inevitable as a result of depletion of high grade ores and rapid trend of increase in production of iron and steel in recent times. In view of this beneficiation studies were carried out on a low grade hematitic iron ore based on the mineralogical characteristics of the sample. Basically gravity concentration techniques were used for separation

Low-grade iron ore includes all mixtures below 62% iron concentration which are not considered to be viable types of ore for use in metallurgy. Several different types of natural iron ore exist but the two most common types used for metal refining are hematite Fe 2 O 3 which is usually 70% iron and magnetite Fe 3 O 4 which is 72% iron.

Mt Morgan had a low ore grade (0.5–1%) compared with the other mines but a relatively high production share (approximately 20%) which led to a short-term increase in the average ore grade for these years [8]. Another increase in the ore grade was caused by Olympic Dam which was discovered at the end of the 1970s and the

Iron ore is the key raw material for steel production enterprises. Generally iron ore with a grade of less than 50% needs to be processed before smelting and utilization. After crushing grinding magnetic separation flotation and gravity separation etc. iron is gradually selected from the natural iron ore.
