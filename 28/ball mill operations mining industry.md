## Ball Mill: Operating principles components Uses 
 · Several types of ball mills exist. They differ to an extent in their operating principle. They also differ in their maximum capacity of the milling vessel ranging from 0.010 liters for planetary ball mills mixer mills or vibration ball mills to several 100 liters for horizontal rolling ball mills.

## Optimizing your SAG mill operation 
 · The mill discharge from these mills consists of slurry which goes to the ball mills for further grinding and coarse pebbles/rocks which are crushed and sent back to the mill. To maximize the capacity of these circuits the general practice is to use grates with pebble ports (reaching 100 mm) instead of normal grate openings to increase the pebble removal.

For the mining industry our semi-autogenous (SAG) grinding mill uses a minimal ball charge in the range of 6-15 percent. It is primarily used in the gold copper and platinum industries as well as in the lead zinc silver and nickel industries. Autogenous (AG) grinding mills involve no grinding media as the ore itself acts as the grinding media.
