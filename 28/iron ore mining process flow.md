 · The process flow is relatively simple. If the crystal grain size is too fine the process of stage grinding stage magnetic separation and fine sieve regrind is adopted. This process is the third stage of grinding and fine grinding after the products on the first and second stages of fine sieve are concentrated and magnetically separated.

## Iron Ore Mining 
MINING AND PROCESSING: Iron ore mining can be broadly divided into two egories namely 1) manual mining which is employed in small mines and 2) mechanized mining is suitable for large iron ore mines. Manual mining method is normally limited to float ores and small mines. Mining of reef ore is also being done manually on a small scale.

Iron Ore Concentration Process Magnetite is mined in large chunks and is crushed into small particles by a series of crushers. After primary crushing with jaw crushers and secondary crushing with gyratory crushers and tertiary crushing with cone or high pressure grinding rolls (HPGR) the ore is screened on vibrating screens to size the particles.
