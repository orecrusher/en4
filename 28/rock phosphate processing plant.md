## How phosphate is mined and processed
The phosphate is sent to a chemical processing plant or fertilizer manufacturing plant. Here molten sulfur shipped to Florida ports and trucked to the plant is used to create sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid is then mixed with the phosphate to make phosphoric acid. The phosphoric acid is the main ingredient in fertilizer but can also be used in animal feed supplements soda or soap.
