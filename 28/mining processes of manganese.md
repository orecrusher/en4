## Manganese 
Manganese is a very brittle hard pinkish-gray metal. It is a reactive metal chemically active with water air and most acids. It hardens and strengthens steel when alloyed with it. It also is used in alloys with aluminum copper and antimony to create highly ferromagnetic compounds although none of these elements are naturally ferromagnetic.
