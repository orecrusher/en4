The iron ore deposits in India are rich in iron content but usually contains high alumina and silica. The current industrial practice results three products namely lump fines and slimes. The lump and fines with or without beneficiation are directly fed to the blast furnace and sintering plant respectively while the super fines or slimes are presently discarded as tailings.

BENEFICIATION Beneficiation is the process where ore is reduced in size and gange separated from the ore. Since all iron ore deposits have unique mineralogy the beneficiation process is specific to each deposit. Separation of certain minerals can be efficiently achieved by taking advantage of the physical electrical and magnetic properties.
