 · The turbine then reaches its maximum rated wind speed above which the power output holds steady under ideal conditions generally 22 to 36 miles per hour depending on the type of windmill. Of course too much wind could damage the turbine so windmills have a cut-out speed too. After that a brake stops the windmill's rotation.

## How Do Wind Turbines Work? 
 · Wind turbines work on a simple principle: instead of using electricity to make wind—like a fan—wind turbines use wind to make electricity. Wind turns the propeller-like blades of a turbine around a rotor which spins a generator which creates electricity. Wind is a form of solar energy caused by a combination of three concurrent events:

## How Much Energy Does A Wind Turbine Produce?
 · If the turbine operated at 5kW for a whole year the energy output would be 5kW x 24 hours per day x 365 days per year equals 43800 kWh. As we've seen the turbine doesn't actually do this. Suppose the turbine actually produced 20000 kWh over the year. The capacity factor could be 20000/43800 = 45.7%.
