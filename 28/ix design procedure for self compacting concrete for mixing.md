SELF COMPACTING CONCRETE. These are the concrete with an extremely high value of the compaction factor which have the ability to self compact due to its own weight and gravity when placing. The concrete doesn't need extra work to be done for compaction. Moreover such concrete has excellent flowability and high resistant to segregation.

## An Experimental Study on Self Compacting Concrete
Self-compacting concrete development must ensure a good balance between deformability and stability. Also compactibility is affected by the characteristics of materials and the mix proportions; it becomes necessary to evolve a procedure for mix design of SCC.

but self-compacting concrete was not developed until the late 1980's in Japan. In Europe it was probably first used in civil works for transportation networks in Sweden in the mid1990's. The EC funded a multi-national industry lead project "SCC" and since then SCC has found increasing use in all European countries.

The mix design and testing methods are different compared with ordinary concrete.wide spread appliions of Self Compacting Concrete have been restricted due to But lack of standard mix design procedure. However getting high strength self compacting concrete is simple compared to medium and low strengths.
