## Processes 
The copper is then recovered by electrolysis. This process is known as SX-EW (solvent extraction/electrowinning). Advantages of these processes are: Much less energy is used than in traditional mining. No waste gases are given off. Low capital investment. Ability to be operated economically on a small scale.
