## Iron Ore 
Low-grade ore is a term applied to iron-rich rocks with cut-off grades in the range of 25ï¿½30% Fe. It was the main supply of iron ore for many centuries of the World's early history of production of iron. Since the 1950s North America's main supply has been low-grade ore. The dominant economic iron mineral in low-grade ore is magnetite.
