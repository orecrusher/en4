## Gold 
Processing. The processing of gold ore involves crushing treatment with chemicals melting (smelting) and further purifiion. It is then poured into moulds where it cools and hardens as gold bars called 'bullion' which make the gold easy to stack and transport. The first stage of processing gold ore

Gold ores are classified "free-milling" and "refractory" based on their response to cyanide dissolution. Bioprocessing can be used to treat refractory gold-bearing sulfide ores as well as carbonaceous gold ores. It is essential to characterize different types of gold ores to understand the extent and nature of gold-entrapment in different associated mineral phases before an appropriate

## Gold Amalgamation 
 · The ores of gold are usually divided into two classes "free milling" and "refractory" ores. The closest practicable definition of these is that in a "free- milling" ore the gold occurs in such a form that it is readily and pretty completely recovered by crushing and amalgama­tion while in refractory ores this is not the case.
