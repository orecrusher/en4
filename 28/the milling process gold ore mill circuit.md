## Milling Process Of Metal Ores 
Milling Process Of Metal Ores. Small portable gold process plant.One of the most serious problems confronting the mining industry today is how to profitably begin the small scale milling of ores from mines where insufficient ore has been developed to warrant an expensive mill installation but where a large plant might be needed later.

## Using Ball Mills to Extract Raw Gold from Ores 
 · Hence a mill is a piece of equipment used to grind ores. Its major purpose is to perform the grinding and blending of rocks and ores to release any free-gold that is contained within them. At major mines the mill was the critical equipment that was required to process the ores that were extracted from deep underground.

The milling process for uranium is similar to that used for other metals such as copper gold or nickel. The first step is to crush the ore and mix it with water so that it can move through a series of mill circuits. After crushing the ore is treated with acid in large tanks to separate the uranium from other minerals in the host rock.

Stamp Mills for Processing Gold Silver Copper Ore A stamp mill is a large mechanical device used to crush ore and extract the desired metals from the host material. It uses heavy steel stamps to crush and break apart material releasing the valuable gold from worthless rock allowing for the extraction of gold for further refining.

## Grindin' at the Mill 
Therefore if the ore does not grind quickly enough in the SAG mills the mill weight increases and the control system reduces feed to the mill to maintain the desired mill weight. While the two SAG mills at Mt Keith are identical in design their operation is not due tosegregation of the coarse and fine material in the stockpile that provides feed to the grinding circuit.
