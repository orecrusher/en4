## How Does a Coal Power Plant Work? 
 · Thermal-based power plants can produce electricity from coal or other fuel sources. The coal-fired process requires three different steps to turn energy released from burning coal to generating electricity for consumption. Coal fired power plants while producing power require a lot of water and produce a lot of pollutants like ash and CO2.

 · Before the coal mill we mix both Cold PA and Hot PA and this optimum temperature air is used for drying purpose of coal which is around 80°C. PA system also varies from design to design. In Cold PA system PA fan takes air suction from atmosphere and some amount of this air goes to APH(Air Pre Heater) and other half of the air directly goes to a header called Cold PA Header.

## Thermal Power Plant Thermal 
☛ THERMAL POWER PLANT OPERATION. The working principle of thermal power plant operation depends on Rankin Cycle. In a thermal power plant coal is coming from coal storage and burnt in the boiler.It converts water into steam. This steam is expanded in the prime-mover (i.e. turbine) which produces mechanical power driving the alternator coupled to the turbine.
