A layer of gravel (see below for size recommendations) should be placed in the trench to a minimum depth of 1 inch. It may be deeper as necessary to ensure minimal slope requirements. All drainage pipes should be placed on the gravel bed in the trench. PVC drainpipe if used should be placed in the trench with the holes facing down.

## Soil mechanics 
Soil classifiion is the separation of soil into classes or groups each having similar characteristics and potentially similar behaviour. A classifiion for engineering purposes should be based mainly on mechanical properties e.g. permeability stiffness strength. The class to which a soil belongs can be used in its description.
