## Water Requirements of the Iron and Steel Industry
Water used by the iron ore mines and concentration plants was also predominantly self supplied from surface source. Water use in the iron and steel industry varied widely and depended on the availability of water age and condition of plants and equipment kinds of processes and plant operating procedures.

## Extraction of Iron Concentration of Ore 
 · Concentration of Ore. The extraction of iron begins with concentration through calcination which is a process in a limited supply of oxygen applied to ores to bring thermal decomposition. An ore of a metal is an impure source. It consists of many impurities other than metal such as sand clay etc.
