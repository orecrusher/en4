## Light
We demonstrate the use of fossilized diatoms (diatomaceous earth) as light traps in regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and fullerene derivative [66]-phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) solar cells. Diatoms the most common type of phytoplankton found in nature are optimized for light absorption through millions of years of adaptive evolution.
