## Deep
• Deep-sea mining is the process of retrieving mineral deposits from the deep sea – the area of the ocean below 200 m. • Depleting terrestrial deposits and rising demand for metals are stimulating interest in the deep sea with commercial mining imminent. • The scraping of the sea floor and pollution from mining processes can wipe out entire species – many yet to be discovered.
