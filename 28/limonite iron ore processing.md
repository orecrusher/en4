## Processing of Nickel Laterite Ores on the Rise
Traditionally nickel has been processed from sulfide ores in an approach similar to copper processing in which the ore is upgraded to concentrates and then smelted. As sulfide ore resources dwindle however processing of lateritic nickel ores is becoming of greater necessity with many recognizing nickel laterite ores as the future of the nickel industry.
