## Quarrying of Stones: Its Methods Selection of Site 
The process of extraction of suitable stones from their natural rock beds or layers is commonly called Quarrying of Stones. It differs from the mining of ores of metals in that whereas quarrying is an operation carried out entirely on the surface mining involves digging below the ground sometimes at considerable depth.

## Quarrying 
Once the overburden has been removed by processes similar to those used in hard rock quarrying deposits of sand and gravel are usually extracted by a range of earth-moving plant (Fig. 15.7). Some sand and gravel pits extract beneath the local water table and are 'wet pits' whereas others exploit wholly above the water and are 'dry pits'.

## History 
The sand sediment was repeatedly reworked by storms and changes in sea level. A process of natural winnowing sorted the quartz from the other minerals and separated grains of similar size. A volcanic eruption around 60 million years ago then covered the super pure silica sand with a thick layer of basalt which protected the sandstone from further erosion.
