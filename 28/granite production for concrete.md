## Economic Exploitation of Gravel in Place of Granite in 
The paper investigated the appliion of gravel as partial economic replacement of granite in concrete production. Concrete was produced using granite/gravel combination in varying percentages of 90/10 80/20 70/30 60/40 50/50 40/60 30/70 20/80 and 10/90. Concrete made from 100 % granite and 100 % gravel served controls while other constituents of concrete were kept constant.
