## low quality of iron ore limonite 
This ore is so rich in limonite (generally grading 47% to 59% iron 0.8 to 1.5% nickel and trace cobalt) that it is essentially similar to low-grade iron ore. As such certain steel smelters in China have developed a process for blending nickel limonite ore with conventional iron ore to produce stainless steel feed products.

 · Limonite or brown ore is to be found at the bottom of some bogs and shallow lakes in favorable situations where the weathering rocks have yielded iron to the water draining into these basins. The limonite accumulates so fast in some places that a lake bottom may be cropped again after a number of years as at Radnor Forges Quebec.

The reserves of limonite ore in Jiangxi province are very large but because the chemical composition of the limonite is not fixed and the iron content is not stable moisture content changes to a large extent. Moreover it be easy to over crushing during crushing and grinding [3-5]. Therefore it belongs to a very refractory iron ore.
