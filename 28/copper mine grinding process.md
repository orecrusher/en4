 · Sulphide and oxides found in the mine are reduced to 1.5in pieces and stored in piles. For sulphide the grinding process is followed by flotation which involves milling material until slurry is formed with particles up to 180 microns in size. The slurry undergoes another process in which copper and other materials are concentrated in froth.

 · Porphyry copper ores usually medium to medium hard require grinding to about 65-mesh to economically liberate the copper minerals from the gangue. Although a clean rougher tailing can often be achieved at 65-mesh the copper mineral is not liberated sufficiently to make a high grade copper concentrate thus some form of regrinding is necessary on the rougher flotation copper concentrate.
