The cost per unit is derived from the variable costs and fixed costs incurred by a production process divided by the number of units produced. Variable costs such as direct materials vary roughly in proportion to the number of units produced though this cost should decline somewhat as unit

## Calculate OEE 
Performance is how the equipment is performing against its capacity. In this calculation we use the ideal cycle time and operating time to determine how many parts the machine can produce under ideal operating conditions. We then calculate the ratio of how many parts we actually produced versus the capacity. Capacity Formula:
