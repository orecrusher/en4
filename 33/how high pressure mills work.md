## The operating principle of the ball mill
 · Therefore the work of the mill with partial load conditions is unprofitable. Energy consumption for ball mills is a function of many factors: the physical properties of the ground material – its specific gravity and hardness; the degree of drum filling by grinding balls; the number of drum rotations etc. Ball mills have low efficiency – no more than 15%.

A high pressure system has higher pressure at its center than the areas around it. Winds blow away from high pressure. Swirling in the opposite direction from a low pressure system the winds of a high pressure system rotate clockwise north of the equator and counterclockwise south of the equator. This is called anticyclonic flow.

## High pressure grinding rolls (HPGR) 
High pressure grinding rolls (HPGR) are used for size reduction or rocks and ores. They compress the feed material between two rotating rollers one of which is in a fixed position and another roller that is floating. The two rotating rollers generate such a high pressure that it grinds the feed material to the desired smaller grain size.
