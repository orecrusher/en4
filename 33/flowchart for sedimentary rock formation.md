Sedimentary Features Just as igneous rocks contain information about the his-tory of their formation sedimentary rocks also have fea-tures and characteristics that help geologists interpret how they formed and the history of the area in which they formed. Bedding The primary feature of sedimentary rocks is horizontal layering called bedding.

As you repeat the process you are layering the different colors on top of one another. By adding pressure to the candy with the book we were able to form a model of sedimentary rock. This is similar to how sedimentary rock forms in nature. After pieces of rock pile up in layers pressure transforms the sediment into sedimentary rock.

## Sedimentary Rocks
Common Sedimentary Rocks. Sandstone limestone and shale are examples of sedimentary rocks. These rocks are frequently formed from river sediments that are deposited in lakes and oceans. When sediments are buried they lose water and become cemented forming rock. Volcanic ash is found in tufffaceous sandstones.

## Sedimentary Rock Formation 
Sedimentary rock formation begins with igneous metamorphic or other sedimentary rocks. When these rocks are exposed at the earth's surface they begin the long slow but relentless process of becoming sedimentary rock. Weathering All rocks are subject to weathering. Weathering is anything that breaks the rocks into smaller pieces or sediments.

Mechanically Formed Sedimentary Rocks: Previously formed rocks are subjected to me­chanical or physical disintegration and thus the rocks are broken into fragments of different sizes. These are called fragmental rock materials or clastic materials which become source materials for the formation of clastic sedimentary rocks.
