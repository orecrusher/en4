## Heap Leaching 
Heap leach kinetics involves complex interplay between solution transport to and fro Confinement of leaching solutions and dissolved metals to the mining area is another challenge. Static heap leaching utilizes a prepared pad lined with geomembranes to avoid solution leakage.

## Heap Leach Pad 
We want to build a heap leach pad with the ore coming from agglomeration. We ended up with the conclusion that we need 8 pads of 130Wx300Lx8H meters. Presently we try to build the first pad and we estimated that we need a stacker an indexing conveyor that will be fed by 11 grass-hoppers.
