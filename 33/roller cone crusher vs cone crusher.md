 · Cone crusher theory. The functional principle of a cone crusher is to compress particles between two surfaces. Particles can be subjected to two different modes of compressive breakage; single particle breakage (SPB) and inter-particle breakage (IPB). The particle bed in the inter-particle breakage mode can either be confined or unconfined.
