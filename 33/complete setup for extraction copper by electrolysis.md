## Purifiion of Copper 
The electrolysis of CuSO 4 using graphite rods produces oxygen and copper.; By changing the electrodes from graphite to pure and impure copper the products can be changed at each electrode.; Electrolysis can be used to purify metals by separating them from their impurities. In the set-up the impure metal is always the anode in this case the impure copper.
