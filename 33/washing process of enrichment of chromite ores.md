## Improving the Quality of Ferruginous Chromite Concentrates 
The low chromium-to-iron ratio of chromite ores is an important issue in some chromite deposits. The value of the chromite ore is indeed dictated in the market by its iron as well as its chromium content. In the present study a chromite concentrate was reprocessed by gravity (spiral concentrator) and magnetic separation to enhance the chromium-to-iron ratio.
