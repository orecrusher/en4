## Rock phosphate solubilization by abiotic and fungal 
 · Rock phosphate (RP) was supplied by Morro Verde Mineração Pratápolis Minas Gerais state Brazil. The rock was ground in a ball mill and serially sieved to pass through 125 and 63 µm sieves. A preliminary assessment revealed that the < 63 µm fraction allowed better solubilization (not shown) and this granulometry was used throughout the experiments.

## Phosphorite Ore Mining Solution 
Phosphate rock is a kind of ore with good grindability. Therefore the grinding process of phosphate rock usually adopts one-stage closed-circuit grinding process or two-stage one-closed circuit grinding process. The grinding equipment used is usually a ball mill.

## Beneficiation of rock phosphate fertilisers by mechano
Mechano-milling is a process where materials are ball-milled at high energy to induce chemical and physical reactions. This study investigated the effect of milling on the properties and agronomic effectiveness of six apatite rock phosphates (RP). The effects of milling were evaluated by X-ray diffraction BET-N2 surface area measurements electron microscopy and solubility in 2% citric acid

## A laboratory study of high chromium alloy wear in 
 · Unlike earlier mill corrosion studies that used devices that merely simulated mill motion the present study utilized a specially designed ball mill whose electrochemical potential can be controlled under operating conditions (Kotlyar et al. 1987 Pozzo and Iwasaki 1989 Pazhianur et al. 1997).The results from this study more closely resemble those expected from the industrial ball mills.

## Pumping equipment in phosphate fertilizer processes 
Solids handling or slurry pumps may be used at the beginning of the process to handle the phosphate rock in hydro transport or in the initial ball mill circuits for sizing the rock. These pumps handle a concentration of 40-55% solids by weight where abrasion and erosion wear are the primary concern.
