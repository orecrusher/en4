The mercury amalgamation process had previously been used but recovered only about 60 per cent of an ore body's gold. In contrast leaching finely ground ore with cyanide can recover up to 97 per cent of the ore body

Cyanide Remediation Processes. The various species of cyanide that remain in tails streams from gold plants are potentially toxic and on some operations the waste streams are processed through a detoxifiion process prior to tails deposition.This reduces the concentrations of these cyanide compounds but does not completely eliminate them from the stream.

 · Cyanide is deadly when swallowed. An amount the size of a grain of rice is enough to kill a person. Exposure to low doses over a long time may cause a swelling in the throat (goiter) which can also be caused by malnutrition. Cyanide is often spilled into waterways during gold mining and when ponds filled with mine wastes burst and spill.
