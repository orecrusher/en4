## Guide To Sawmills 
Oil-fired burners never caught on due to the cost and overwhelming abundance of wood waste fuel. By the mid-1900s electricity phased steam power out at most stationary sawmills. Electric power wasn't as practical with portable sawmills due to most remote mill sites being off the grid. Mobile mills turned to diesel and gasoline power sources.
