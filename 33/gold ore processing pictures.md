## Extracting Gold 
To isolate pure gold mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.
