 · The total gear reduction (ratio) is determined by multiplying each individual gear ratio from each gear set stage. If a gearbox contains 3:1 4:1 and 5:1 gear sets the total ratio is 60:1 (3 x 4 x 5 = 60). In our example above the 3450 rpm electric motor would have its speed reduced to 57.5 rpm by using a 60:1 gearbox.

## What are Reduction Gears? What is Gear Reduction? 
 · Reduction gear is an arrangement by which an input speed can be lowered for a requirement of slower output speed with same or more output torque. A reduction gear assembly consists of a set of rotating gears connected to a wheel work. The high speed incoming motion from the wheel work is transmitted to the set of rotating gears wherein the motion or torque is changed.

## How to select gear ratio for a gear reducer?
 · For speed reduction the gear ratio is calculated using the equation: G = N MOTOR / N LOAD. where G is the gear ratio and N is the angular velocity of the motor and the load. The way gear reducers work is that they essentially multiply the output torque of the motor. So for instance a small motor with a gear reducer may be less expensive and
