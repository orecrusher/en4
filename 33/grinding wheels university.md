 · Usually vitrified wheels are used at speeds less than 6500 surface feet per minute. At higher speeds the vitrified bond may break. Organic bond wheels are generally the choice between 6500 and 9500 surface feet per minute. Working at higher speeds usually requires specially designed wheels for high speed grinding.

 · Abrasive wheels in particular require careful attention due to the risk of injury through 'bursting'. This may arise from uneven wear grooves localised heating imbalance use of a tapered spindle 'heavy' use or excessive speed. Side-grinding and braking of the wheel by contact with the wheel itself are dangerous practices.

## Laser processing of high performance grinding wheels 
High performance grinding is a process that produces engineering components with a desired surface roughness. The grinding efficiency of vitrified grinding wheels deteriorates as the sharp cutting edges become blunt due to the formation of wear flats. Dressing is essentially a sharpening operation designed to generate a specific topography on the working surface of the grinding wheel.

Dressing the wheel. If someone does grind aluminum on a grinding wheel causing it to be coated in aluminum it doesn't mean the wheel needs to be thrown away. But you will need a dresser which is a hand tool with two little star-shaped wheels on the top. The wheels are made of fairly soft steel and are much softer than the stone.

Besides a grinding wheel is useless when it comes to sharpening the back of your plane blades and chisels. For this you need a flat surface and this is not available on a rotating wheel. Opinions differ as to whether it is better to grind the bevel on a blade hollow as happens on a grinding wheel or flat as happens in manual sharpening with a whetstone.
