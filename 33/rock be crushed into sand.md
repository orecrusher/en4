Decomposed granite is rock of granitic origin that has weathered to the point that it readily fractures into smaller pieces of weak rock. Further weathering produces rock that easily crumbles into mixtures of gravel-sized particles sand and silt-sized particles with some clay.Eventually the gravel may break down to produce a mixture of silica sand silt particles and clay.
