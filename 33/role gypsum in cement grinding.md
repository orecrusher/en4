## Cement Gypsum 
Gypsum plays a very important role in controlling the rate of hardening of the cement. The retardation mechanism of gypsum is: when cement is hydrated gypsum reacts with C3A quickly to generate calcium sulfoaluminate hydrate which deposits and forms a protection film on the cement particles to hinder the hydration of C3A and delay the setting time of cement.
