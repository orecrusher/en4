## Iron Ore 
Mining iron ore or other iron-bearing materials from the ground is the first step to make iron and steel. Iron ores are rocks from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. These rocks are usually found in the form of hematite (Fe 2 O 3) or magnetite (Fe 3 O 4). Common types of iron ores and their iron contents are shown in Table 2.1.

Because of the magnetic properties of the ore in Jayville new technologies were used most notably the Magnetic Separation of Iron Ore. In 1895 the Ball-Norton electro-magnetic separator was used in a number of plants built and experiments made for magnetic separation notably those at Benson Mines in St. Lawrence county New York; at the Jayville mine and at the Mineville in Es county.
