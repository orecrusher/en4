the water would cause damage to the stone later. Seasoning was achieved by covering the stone with soil for about four months (Guin-ness 2002). Once the stone was properly seasoned the exposed surfaces were considered case-hardened creating a finish more resistant to weathering. At this point the stone was shipped for dressing and carving.

In some cases water quality impacts were so severe that acid mine drainage at the mine site will generate water pollution in perpetuity. In 2012 state and federal documents were reviewed for fourteen copper sulfide mines representing 89% of U.S. copper production in 2010 – the most recent data on copper production available from the U.S. Geological Survey.

Mine drainage can pose serious water-quality problems. In Colorado alone more than 1300 miles of streams are impacted by metal input associated with mining activity. An understanding of the processes that control metal transport and attenuation in these waters is critical in assessments of the potential environmental impact of mine drainage.

 · For every 100 pounds (45 kilograms) of turquoise mined only about 25 pounds (11 kilograms) or 25 percent are considered jewelry quality and of the 25 pounds only about 1 pound (0.4 kilograms) is considered high-grade or gem quality. It's not uncommon for this grade of turquoise to sell between $40-$200 per carat.

## Water Quality Concerns for Ponds 
 · Water quality conditions in a pond are controlled by both natural processes and human influences. Natural factors such as the source of the pond water and the types of rock and soil in the pond watershed will influence some water quality characteristics. These factors are difficult to control but usually cause few problems.
