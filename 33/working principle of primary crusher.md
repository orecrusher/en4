Roll crushers do however give a very close product size distribution and if the ore is not too abrasive they do not have high maintenance costs. Roll crushers have a theoretical MAXIMUM reduction ratio of 4:1. If a 2 inch particle is fed to the roll crusher the absolute smallest size one could expect from the crusher is 1/2 inch.

## Impact Crusher 
Gyratory crushers work on the same principle as cone crushers (Figure 4.4(c)). These have a gyratory motion driven by an eccentric wheel. These machines will not accept materials with a large particle size and therefore only jaw or impact crushers should be considered as primary crushers.
