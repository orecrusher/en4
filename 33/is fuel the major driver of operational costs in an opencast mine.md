## Five Supply Chain Drivers 
 · Supply chain capabilities are guided by the decisions you make regarding the five supply chain drivers. Each of these drivers can be developed and managed to emphasize responsiveness or efficiency depending on changing business requirements. As you investigate how a supply chain works you learn about the demands it faces and the capabilities it needs to be successful.

Mine cost estimation may be done at many levels. At first it may be a simple "back of the envelope" estimation using similar operations to benchmark against. Later it may be decided to use an existing mine that the company owns and factor and compare costs against them.

## 3. CALCULATION OF MACHINE RATES
3.1 Introduction. The unit cost of logging or road construction is essentially derived by dividing cost by production. In its simplest case if you rented a tractor with operator for $60 per hour - including all fuel and other costs - and you excavated 100 cubic meters per hour your unit cost for excavation would be $0.60 per cubic meter.
