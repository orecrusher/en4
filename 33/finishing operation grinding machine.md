## Finish Boring vs. Reaming 
 · Finish boring is also more forgiving than reaming if a shop is using a machine tool with a lot of runout at the spindle as an adjustment of the boring head can compensate for such runout. Additionally precise hole positioning is less critical than in reaming because if a drill does not drill the hole straight a finish boring head will true up the hole.
