 · 1 Drawing. The first step in making copper wire is what's known as the drawing process. Rods of copper are set on a machine which will pull the rod through a drawing die. The end where the rod goes in the die is the same size as the rod but the die narrows which forces the diameter of the copper rod to shrink and pulls it out to a longer length.
