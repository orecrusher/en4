## MANUAL OF STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES FOR CYANIDE 
Cyanide is a substance that often occurs in combination with other chemicals in the environment. It combines with other substances to form metallo-cyanide organo-cyanide or cyano-nitrile complexes (Duodoroff 1976 1980; Leduc et al. 1982; Leduc 1984 Eisler 1991). Organically-combined cyanides

They have a high solubility in the alkaline cyanide have a large amount consumption of cyanide and dissolved oxygen in the solution forming a variety of cyanide complex compound and SCN-therefore it affects the oxidation and the leaching of gold. The most important oxygen consumption minerals in the ore are pyrrhotite marcasite arsenopyrite.
