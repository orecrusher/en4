Our milled limestone is used in the ironmaking process to produce the slag which removes impurities from the iron ore while making liquid pig iron. Our milled limestone is added to iron sinter and pellets to add flux and promote agglomeration in your products. Blast furnaces can add limestone directly to the burden to promote slag formation and protect the refractory.

## Lime in the Steel Industry 
Lime is used to convert iron into 'pig iron'. In the blast furnace finely ground or granular limestone (with a low sulfur and alkali content) is used together with finely ground lime to convert ore into pig iron. The pig iron is later processed into steel. Lime is used as a fluxing agent in electric arc furnaces and basic oxygen furnaces.

Pig iron also known as crude iron is an intermediate product of the iron industry in the production of steel which is obtained by smelting iron ore in a blast furnace.Pig iron has a very high carbon content typically 3.8–4.7% along with silica and other constituents of dross which makes it very brittle and not useful directly as a material except for limited appliions.

 · Later during the experiments on the production of pig iron in the electric furnace at Domnarfvet Sweden 280 tons of crude non containing from 0.95 to 3.09 per cent carbon were produced. This showed the possibility of producing pig steel in an electric shaft furnace. Later at Trollhattan Sweden these results were confirmed in a larger furnace.

Description. Pig iron is the intermediate product of smelting iron ore with a high-carbon fuel such as coke usually with limestone as a flux. Charcoal and anthracite have also been used as fuel. Pig iron has a very high carbon content typically 3.5–4.5% which makes it very brittle and not useful directly as a material except for limited appliions.

## Pig_iron 
 · Pig iron is the immediate product of smelting iron ore with coke and limestone in a blast furnace.Pig iron has a very high carbon content typically 3.5% which makes it very brittle and not useful directly as a material except for limited appliions.. Pig iron is typically poured directly out of the bottom of the blast furnace through a trough into a ladle car for transfer to the steel

## limestone in pig iron process 
 · Limestone is the reducing agent without limestone the iron ore i.e Fe2O3 will never get reduced to Pig iron i.e Fe.. "calcination" should be lesser inside the blast furnace to reduce the coke rate that's why sinter is being used nowadays as in sintering process limestone is calcinised outside the furnace which reduces the coke rate by 5–8%.

## What Is Involved in Pig Iron Production? (with pictures)
Jessica Ellis Iron ore is combined with charcoal in a blast furnace to create pig iron. The process of pig iron production involves the combination of iron ore charcoal and an intermediary material known as a flux inside a blast furnace.As the materials combine with intense heat much of the iron ore melts creating a superheated liquid form.

## CHEMICAL GRADE LIMESTONE 
 · Our chemical grade limestone is used in the ironmaking process to produce the slag which removes impurities from the iron ore while making liquid pig iron. Our limestone is added to iron sinter and pellets to add flux and promote agglomeration in your products. Blast furnaces can add limestone directly to the burden to promote slag formation and protect the refractory.
