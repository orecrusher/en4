 · As expected the copper in the circuit reduced to a low level but when sulfide copper–gold ore processing resumed the copper concentration in the leach circuit did not attain previous levels even though a higher copper orebody was being mined. The copper recovery plant was operated intermittently for a few months and was eventually shut down.

Copper sulphide and copper metal (with its inherent cobalt content) because of their higher densities and immiscibility with the slag settle from the molten slag into the metal bath. Improving recoveries via this mechanism would involve decreasing the viscosity of the slag (by increased temperature or flux additions) and / or increasing the settling time to allow smaller droplets to fall.

Copper slag was characterized and processed. The pyro-metallurgical processing prospects to generate utilizable materials were arrived at through rigorous thermodynamic analysis. Carbothermal reduction at elevated temperature (near 1440°C) helped recover a majority of the metal values (e.g. Fe Cu and Mo) into the iron-rich alloy product which can be a feed material for steel making.

1.2. Copper smelting: from ore to metal The most important sources of copper are sulﬁdes oxides and carbonates (Artioli 2010). When exploited by humans these minerals may be called ores (Killick 2014). Copper ores need to be processed thermally and chemically 'smelted' in order to extract the metallic copper.

## Slag PM – Recovery Precious Metals from Old Slag
A. Slag is the glass-like by-product left over after a desired metal has been separated from its raw ore. While slags are generally used to remove waste in metal smelting they can also serve other purposes such as assisting in the temperature control of the smelting and minimizing any re-oxidation of the final liquid metal product before the molten metal is removed from the furnace and used
