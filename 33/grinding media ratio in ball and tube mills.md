tumbling mills. These contain a charge of loose crushing bodies-the grinding medium-which is free to move inside the mill thus comminuting the ore particles. The grinding medium may be steel rods or balls hard rock or in some cases the ore itself. In the grinding process particles between 5 and 250 nun are reduced in size to

Ball milling is a grinding technique that uses media to effectively break down pigment agglomerates and aggregates to their primary particles. Using a rotor or disc impeller to create collisions of the grinding media the impact and force created by the bead mills collisions break down the pigment agglomerates.
