## How copper is made 
Despite this early production most copper used in the United States was imported from Chile until 1844 when mining of large deposits of high-grade copper ore around Lake Superior began. The development of more efficient processing techniques in the late-1800s allowed the mining of lower-grade copper ores from huge open-pit mines in the western United States.

New Afton is an operating block cave mine. As of the year-end 2019 the mine operated at a rate of approximately 15600 tpd. Ore is all from the B1 and B2 Caves with development underway towards the B3 and C Zones. Ore is transported from the drawpoints on the extraction level by a load haul dump unit (LHD) to an ore pass.

## Copper extraction 
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source local environmental regulations and other factors.. As in all mining operations the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

## Copper Flotation 
The copper ore slurry from the grinding mills is mixed with milk of lime (simply water and ground-up limestone) to give a basic pH pine oil (yes it comes from trees -- a by-product of paper mills) to make bubbles an alcohol to strengthen the bubbles and a collector chemical called potassium amyl xanthate (or the potassium salt of an alkyl dithiocarbonate).
