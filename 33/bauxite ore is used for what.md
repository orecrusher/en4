Unlike the base metal ores bauxite does not require complex processing because most of the bauxite mined is of an acceptable grade. Ore quality can be improved by relatively simple and inexpensive processes for removing clay known as "beneficiation" which include washing wet screening and mechanical or manual sorting.

## Red mud 
Red mud formally termed bauxite residue is an industrial waste generated during the processing of bauxite into alumina using the Bayer process.It is composed of various oxide compounds including the iron oxides which give its red colour. Over 95% of the alumina produced globally is through the Bayer process; for every tonne of alumina produced approximately 1 to 1.5 tonnes of red mud are
