## Oxidation Filtration (Iron Removal) 
Â Â· Oxidation/filtration can be used as a special case of pressurized granular-media filtration where the granular media alyzes the oxidation and precipitation of iron and manganese. Manganese-oxide (MnOx) media which include manganese greensand and pyrolucite are commonly used in oxidation/filtration processes because of their unique adsorptive and alytic capabilities.

## Concentration 
The ore is ground in the concentration plant which means that impurities can be removed â€“ at the same time as raising the iron content. In order to access and remove impurities the ore is ground to form a fine concentrate and then mixed with water making a slurry.

Â Â· Iron water filters that use a redox or oxidization media have a longer lifespan of around 5 to 10 years. Sometimes this media can last beyond 10 years but not commonly. Depending on what system you opt for your media may need replacing after less than 5 years if your water has a high content of iron manganese and other contaminants.

pH Tolerance: Filox-Râ„¢ operates within a much broader pH range than most iron-reduction media and can be used to treat waters that are significantly lower in pH than Birm. The wider window of pH acceptability (5.0 to 9.0 according to the manufacturer as compared with 6.8 and up for Birm) means that when using Filox it is often unnecessary to add pH amendment to an iron removal system.

## Magnetic Separation 
Our ferromagnetic wet drum separators can be used in iron ore separation plants in both rougher or cleaner beneficiation appliions. We also provide demagnetising solutions that reverse the residual effects that magnetic separation has on the magnetic viscosity of ferrous slurries to return the mineral stream to an acceptable viscosity for downstream processing.
