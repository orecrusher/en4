## Reducing PFAS in Drinking Water with Treatment 
 · Activated carbon (GAC) is made from organic materials with high carbon contents such as wood lignite and coal; and is often used in granular form called granular activated carbon (GAC). GAC has been shown to effectively remove PFAS from drinking water when it is used in a flow through filter mode after particulates have already been removed.

## Activated Carbon 
Our activated carbon products are also used as colorants carriers or alysts in industrial processes and the pore size distribution is highly important in most appliions. Activated carbon also called activated charcoal is a form of carbon that has been processed to create millions of tiny pores between the carbon atoms resulting in a dramatically increased surface area.

## Charcoal 
Charcoal is normally obtained from the burning of wood peat bones cellulose or other carbonaceous substances with little or insufficient air. It is an amorphous carbon in the form of highly porous microcrystalline graphite. When charcoal is used as an additive to clay it can help save energy in brick production.
