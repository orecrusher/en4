## 10 Safety Precautions You Must Be Aware of When Performing 
 · An unexpected conveyor shutdown can lead to costly work stoppages. To avoid these interruptions and expenses conveyors should be subjected to routine preventive maintenance. Conveyors that are continually maintained will have long lives and continue to run efficiently and safely over their service life.

I am not aware of any dry friction models that are explicitly time dependent; that would be a very strange model of dry friction. I can't even take a wild stab at what could cause that.

## Conveyor system disadvantages and alternatives 
 · Conveyor systems are not portable: Conveyors are fixed in place which can be particularly problematic if you need to reconfigure your warehouse layout to accommodate increased demand. Because your pickers have to remain with the conveyor to keep up with the flow of goods conveyors can also pose challenges when you're adopting new picking methodologies.
