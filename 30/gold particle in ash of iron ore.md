Most people think of gold nuggets and such as the source of gold but the truth is that very little of the new gold produced comes from nuggets - nearly all newly mined gold comes from ores mined from the natural hard rocks that contain gold in tiny even microscopic particles. This article is created to describe what these ores are like.

Alternatively using soda ash for pH adjustment can reduce gold depression. Where gold is associated with pyrite in base metal ores where iron sulphides are depressed and report to the tailings a separate tailings pyrite flotation concentrate should be considered. Producing a pyrite concentrate with associated gold maximizes gold recovery.

Many of the particles encountered in mining are characterized by sieves (classifiers). Recent advances in computers cameras and software make image analysis practical for samples with sizes larger than several microns in diameter. As particle size decreases sieving and/or dynamic image analysis becomes more arduous or impossible and laser diffraction becomes the technique of choice.
