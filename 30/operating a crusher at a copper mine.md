Mine haul-truck capacity is an important factor at primary crusher installations because it is cost-effective to integrate truck cycle time at the crusher station with mine/shovel operations. If a primary crusher dump pocket is undersized and unable to handle the mine's trucks then operators must slowly meter the ore into the receiving hopper.
