 · How screw presses work. A screw press (SP) provides sludge dewatering by conveying the sludge along the inside of a permeable cylinder. It is based on a slowly-rotating (~5 RPM) Archimedean screw within a cylindrical screen (otherwise termed drum filter/screen or basket).It is normally inclined by ~20° to the horizontal to assist with the draining of water into the sump.

 · The precoat process involves mixing the filter aid into clear liquid or mother filtrate in a tank. Diatomite filter aids usually work best with a precoat slurry concentration in the 0.3–0.6 wt.% range. This slurry then goes to the filter where the filter medium captures the solids. The clean filtrate returns to the precoat tank.
