 · The cost of a process is generally an investment equivalent to the substructure. Non-GMP plants have between 40% and 60% of manufacturing area and a minimum of support (about 20% of soft cost). Time from construction to start-up would be 18–36 months for a biopharmaceutical plant and 6–12 months for a non-GMP plant.

The Torero plant will convert waste wood into biocarbon suitable for the blast furnaces process. We will thus reduce the injection of fossil pulverized coal which will in turn reduce our CO 2 emissions. It also offers an alternative to the current incineration of the particularly difficult waste wood stream.
