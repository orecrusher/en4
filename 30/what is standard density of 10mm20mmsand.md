## Water Density by Temperature 
 · The Math / Science. The formula for the density of water based on temperature is: ρ = ρH2O 1+ β(T −T 0) ρ = ρ H 2 O 1 + β ( T - T 0) where: ρ is the density of water at a specific temperature. ρ H20 is the nominal density of water. β is the volumetric temperature expansion coefficient β for water is 0.0002. T 0 is standard temperature.

 · Always keep an eye on your units: it's standard to use g or kg per cm³ or m³ so use our unit converters if your measurements are in different units. To calculate density you divide the mass by the volume: Density = Mass ÷ Volume. Density is often written in mathematics as the symbol p or D. Mass can be written as m and volume can be

Particle density and bulk density are two basic ways to express sediment weight. Particle density is defined as the mass of a unit volume of sediment solids. A simple example is that if 1 cm 3 of solid material weighs 2.65 g the particle density is 2.65 g/cm 3. Particle densities generally fall between 2.60 and 2.75 g/cm 3 for mineral particles.
