## Ball Mills 
The working principle is that cement is removed from the mill before over-grinding has taken place. The cement is then separated into a fine fraction which meets finished product requirements and a coarse fraction which is returned to mill inlet. Recirculation factor that is the ratio of mill throughput to fresh feed is up to three.

## The Cement Manufacturing Process 
 · There are more than twenty types of cement used to make various specialty concrete however the most common is Portland cement. Cement manufacturing is a complex process that begins with mining and then grinding raw materials that include limestone and clay to a fine powder called raw meal which is then heated to a sintering temperature as high as 1450 °C in a cement kiln.

The slump test was introduced in 1918 by Duff Abrams a prolific American civil engineer and concrete researcher as part of his work defining the effects of water/cement ratio on concrete strength. The test is performed with the slump cone originally called the Abrams cone and provides a qualitative measurement of workability but not a direct indiion of water/cement ratio.

Since it does not move the main body can be made larger and taller. This means that more equipment can be housed in the mill and that taller sails can be used to collect even more wind. Most smock mills are eight sided although this can vary from six to 12. Tower mills are further improvements on smock mills.
