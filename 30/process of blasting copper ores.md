## Copper Concentrates 
The process of liberation of copper ores depends upon whether they are oxide or sulfide ores. Subsequent steps depend on the nature of the ore containing the copper. For oxide ores a hydrometallurgical liberation process is normally undertaken which uses the soluble nature of the ore minerals to the advantage of the metallurgical treatment plant.

## Mining and Mineral Use 
Copper is mined and extracted from copper ores. To extract the metal from the ore the rock is melted at a temperature greater than 900°C which requires a lot of energy. Extracting metal from rock is so energy intensive that if you recycle just 40 aluminum cans you will save the energy equivalent of one gallon of gasoline.

## Electrical blasting disintegration of copper
The effect of electrical blast parameters is studied for grinding mineral materials by example of copper-nickel ore. It is shown that the average energy consumed by the electrical blasting is within 5–50 J/g. The particle disintegration mechanism has been considered at high and low electric conductivity of ore. It is established that grinding and separation of particles by size are possible
