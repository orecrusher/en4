This paper mainly introduces the raw mill in cement plant. In order to achieve the desired setting qualities in the finished product a quantity (2-8% but typically 5%) of calcium sulfate (usually gypsum or anhydrite) is added to the clinker and the mixture is finely ground to form the finished cement powder. This is achieved in a cement raw mill.

## Power consumption of cement manufacturing plant
Fuel and electricity costs are the single largest variable production cost at cement mill plants. Variable costs are typically about 50% of overall operating costs so energy cost is usually the single largest production cost besides raw materials. Labor cost is relatively a small part of the Cement Manufacturing Plant.

## Rawmill 
A raw mill is the equipment used to grind raw materials into "rawmix" during the manufacture of cement. Rawmix is then fed to a cement kiln which transforms it into clinker which is then ground to make cement in the cement mill.The raw milling stage of the process effectively defines the chemistry (and therefore physical properties) of the finished cement and has a large effect upon the

## Manufacturing process 
The raw mix is fed into a circular storage unit called a raw mix storage. Then the mix is extracted transversely from the stockpile by reclaimers and conveyed to a raw mill bin called the raw mix bin for grinding. The other raw materials that are used in cement manufacturing called additives are high purity limestone sand and iron ore.
