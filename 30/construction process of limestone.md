## How does weathering affect limestone? 
 · Weathering is the breakdown of rock by physical chemical or biological processes. Limestone areas are predominantly affected by chemical weathering when rainwater which contains a weak carbonic acid reacts with limestone. This causes the limestone to dissolve. Carbon dioxide from the respiration of animals (and ourselves) is one cause of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
