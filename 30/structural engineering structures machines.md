We use machine learning to elucidate how composition affects the relative energies of these -points which can direct efforts to engineer band structures with high degeneracy and weighted mobility. Similar to the valence balanced rule that predicts the stability of half-Heusler phases [ 7 ] we find that a new valence difference rule predicts the relative energies of the - points.
