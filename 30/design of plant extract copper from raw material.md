## Materials of construction 
 · This is avoided during design by selecting materials that are not vulnerable in the specific corrosion environment and by eliminating high stresses (Towler et al. 2013). The source of stress corrosion is often due to the development of stresses during fabriion and welding and can cause failure prematurely in as short amount of time as minutes or as long as years.

However by far the greatest extension in the use of copper resulted from Michael Faraday's discovery of electromagnetic induction in 1831 and the way that the effect could be used to generate electricity. The same principle was used to develop electric motors. The electric lamp was invented by Sir Joseph Swan in 1860 and brought to a commercial design by Thomas Edison in 1879.
