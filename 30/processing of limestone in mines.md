## PROCESSING OF MINING PLAN 
Abandoned mines are liability. Thus the systematic and scientific mining is expanded beyond mining operations to Closure of Mines. The concept revolves around Planning for Closure before commencement of mining; even before wining the FIRST ton of ore/mineral. Mine Closure Plan has been introduced in 2003.
