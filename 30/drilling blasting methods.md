Diamond drilling method is suitable for drilling at any angle to obtain cores of friable strata as well as the hardest rock. It has been adopted for drilling upto a depth of 3000 m and hole diameter upto 200 mm. Drilling upto such large depths is not required in coal mining areas where the maximum drilling depth is upto 1000 m as coal mines are rarely deeper than that.

 · Bulk of blasting in mines involves charging explosives into holes drilled in rock. The mouth of the drill hole is called the collar and the end is the toe. Drilling is carried out by hand hammer and chisel which tend to be tedious and slow processes in hard-rock mining. The limitations to hand-drilled holes does not exceed 400 mm in length.

## Blast Hole Drilling: The Basic Process 
 · There are two available methods of secondary blasting. The first is plaster or mud-cap blasting. This method involves firing a charge of explosive placed on the rock and covered with clay (or a "mud-cap"). The concussive force of the blast further fragments the rock breaking it up into more manageable pieces.
