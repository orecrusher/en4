It was a means of decarburizing pig iron by slow oxidation with iron ore as the oxygen source as the iron was manually stirred using a long rod. Puddling was done in a reverberatory furnace allowing coal or coke to be used as fuel. The decarburized iron having a higher melting point than cast iron was raked into globs by the puddler.
