The fuel consumption for the 4-71T varies between .370 to .355 lb/hp hour. At full turbo boost the consumption in terms of lb/hp hour is also better. This averages approx 24% less fuel per kWh than the naturally aspirated engine. So continuous full power (157 kW 2300 rpm) it will use approx 46.9 less 24% = 34 liters per hour.

 · Dash readouts are notoriously disingenuous in their calculations and fuel use will vary depending upon engine make and size. A 12L truck might be in the .6-.7 gpm range a 15L truck will be closer to .8-1 gpm. With fuel prices in the mid $3's you're looking at anywhere from $21-$35 in fuel being burned over the course of a 10 hour break.

At that time it differed from most on-highway engines by using an overhead camshaft and "drive by wire" electronic control.In 1993 it was popular on many USA buses in the 11.1 L (677 cu in) displacement.Although the graph on this page of their site compares the idling fuel consumption of vehicles with 1 litre 3 litre and 5 litre engines it does show consumption over time.

 · Keep money in your wallet and save fuel. An idling car uses between 1/5 to 7/10 of a gallon of fuel an hour. An idling diesel truck burns approximately one gallon of fuel an hour. With average U.S. prices for diesel fuel topping $2 a gallon 1 that's about $2 an hour wasted. See how air pollution can vary block by block.

Idling Wastes Fuel and Increases Engine Wear Idling a heavy-duty truck consumes about 0.8 gallon of fuel per hour. Even when diesel costs as little as $2.50 a gallon fuel for one 10-hour rest period will cost $20. Typically a long-haul truck idles about 1800 hours per year using about 1500 gallons of diesel.

 · Fuel Consumption -- Tractors -- Page 1. Sep 17 2009· Fuel Consumption As a general rule of thumb a modern diesel will use about 1/3 of a pound of fuel per horsepower per hour at peak power. A gallon of Diesel fuel is 7.3 pounds. By that then a 44hp engine will use about 14.5 pounds per hour. That is roughly 2 gallons per hour.
