## 4. What are the environmental impacts of biofuel production?
The contribution of different biofuels to reducing fossil-fuel consumption varies widely when the fossil energy used as an input in their production is also taken into account. The fossil energy balance of a biofuel depends on factors such as feedstock characteristics production loion agricultural practices and the source of energy used for the conversion process.
