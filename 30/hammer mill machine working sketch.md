## The Fundamentals of a Vertical Machining Center (VMC)
 · Introduction to Vertical Machining. Vertical Machining has been around in its most basic form for more than 150 years. Yet it's still one of the newest forms of machining technology (turning/lathes is the oldest). The process of "milling" entails a rotating cutter or drilling bit and a movable work table which the workpiece is affixed to.

## Milling (machining) 
The integration of milling into turning environments and of turning into milling environments begun with live tooling for lathes and the occasional use of mills for turning operations led to a new class of machine tools multitasking machines (MTMs) which are purpose-built to provide for a default machining strategy of using any combination of milling and turning within the same work envelope.
