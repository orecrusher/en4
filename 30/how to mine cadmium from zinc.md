## Cadmium resources reserves and production
Cadmium is generally recovered as a byproduct from zinc concentrates. Zinc-to-cadmium ratios in typical zinc ores range from 200:1 to 400:1. Sphalerite (ZnS) the most economically significant zinc mineral commonly contains minor amounts of cadmium which shares certain similar chemical properties with zinc and often substitutes for zinc in the sphalerite crystal lattice.

## zinc and cadmium mining 
Cadmium is produced mainly as a by-product of mining smelting and refining of zinc and to a lesser degree as a by-product of lead and copper manufacturing. Most of the cadmium produced is used in the production of nickel-cadmium batteries which in 2004 represented 81 per cent of the total amount of cadmium.

 · 1/4/2006· Mining of lead and zinc were the core activities of Kabwe mine while cadmium and silver were produced as by-products. The smelting processes produced a significant amount of copper. The spatial distribution of four heavy metals in soils in the northern eastern southern and western directions of the mine was analyzed using atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS).
