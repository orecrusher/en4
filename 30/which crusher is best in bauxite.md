## Tips to maximize crushing efficiency 
 · The settings on a jaw crusher are designed to produce material ideal for secondary crushing. The best particle shape is typically found in material that is about the same size as the closed-side setting. Smaller sizes will contain a higher proportion of elongated particles because they have passed through the crusher without being touched.

## Aluminium production process
ALUMINA PRODUCTION. Bauxite is crushed dried and ground in special mills where it is mixed with a small amount of water. This process produces a thick paste that is collected in special containers and heated with steam to remove most of the silicon present in bauxites. The ore is loaded into autoclaves and treated with lime–caustic soda.
