The iron pelletizing process is often associated with low grade iron ore following a range of liberation techniques to prepare and make suitable for the blast furnace. In summary pelletizing is achieved by combining the iron ore with water and a specific binder which is then rolled up in drum to produce relatively uniform pellets which can then be easily handled in downstream processes.

Our heavy-duty iron ore balling drums are relied on by some of the industry's top producers to process iron ore fines into pellets for the steelmaking process. The use of a disc pelletizer is a popular alternative approach to pelletizing iron ore fines as this offers more control over pellet size and produces a more refined pellet product.
