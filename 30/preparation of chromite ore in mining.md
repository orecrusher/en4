## Chromite Ore 
Chromite ore is usually a combination of spinels with associated minerals such as calcite magnetite talc serpentines and uvarovite. Chromites crystals exhibit an octahedral structure similar to magnetite. The Cr 3+ ions are in the octahedral position with oxygen. The chromium rich phase is antiferromagnetic.

## Chromite: The only mineral ore of chromium metal
Chromite is important because it is the only economic ore of chromium an essential element for a wide variety of metal chemical and manufactured products. Many other minerals contain chromium but none of them are found in deposits that can be economically mined to produce chromium.

A few larger mines hired workers and provided room and board. Most operations were small and many investments found little return. When the grade of the chromite was low mills were needed to concentrate the ore; miners often converted mills used for gold.
