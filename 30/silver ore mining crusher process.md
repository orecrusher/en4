Comminution is the process where ore particles are liberated from gangue material through progressive size reduction in the form of crushing grinding cutting or vibrating. The costs associated with power supply grinding media and liners used in comminution circuits almost always represent the single largest cost in gold extraction processes (Mosher 2005).

Gold and silver are products of the copper mining and smelting process. They follow the same production pathway as our copper ore from the mine to the smelter. At the refinery we lower copper anodes (which contain gold and silver) into an acid solution. Gold and silver drop off into the bottom of the tank as electrolytic slimes.

The process works best when the ore is crushed to small pieces before roasting. Additives such as common rock salt are often added to the mix before it is heated to enhance the reaction of the sulfides. Once the ores are fully roasted and the sulfur is driven off the extraction of the gold or silver from the ore is not especially difficult.
