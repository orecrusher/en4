Iron-making blast furnace requires high air permeability during operating so the iron ore fines should be processed into iron ore pellets in the iron ore pelletizing plant in advance. During the processing of high-grade iron ores which don't need beneficiation many ore fines are generated which are usually regarded as waste.

 · Pelletizing is the process of converting very fine iron ores into spheres (normally 8mm-20mm in diameter) known as pellets. These pellets are suitable for both blast furnaces and direct iron reduction processes.. Pelletizing normally has four processes: (i) receipt of raw materials (ii) pretreatment (iii) balling and (iv) induration and cooling.
