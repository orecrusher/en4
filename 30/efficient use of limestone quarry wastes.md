## Concrete with enriched quarry limestone waste as a coarse 
 · The efficiency of the use of enriched limestone waste as a coarse aggregate in industrial conditions was checked at the Moscow plant of precast concrete No. 10. Crushed limestone of the grading of Russian fraction 3-10 mm with water-absorption equal to 10% as a very vulnerable coarse aggregate was used for this aim.
