Lime Saturation Factor (LSF) is the ratio of the actual amount of lime in raw meal/clinker to the theoretical lime required by the major oxides (SiO 2 Al 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3) in the raw mix or clinker.It is practically impossible to complete the reaction to 100% in a reactor like rotary kiln therefore there will always be some unreacted lime (CaO f) known as free lime.

## Safety Practices for Kiln Rooms 
Kilns are placed in the kiln room in a safe loion according to the kiln room specifiions. Back of kiln is a minimum of 18 inches from the wall. Front of the kiln has a 3 foot clear passage way. Kiln stand is placed on a level surface that will not be damaged by heat. Cement floor is recommended.

## Clinkerization 
Kiln Speed should be such that volumetric loading is within the range 10-15% and heat transfer is maximized. Pre-calciner kilns generally rotate at 3.5-4.5 rpm. Under normal conditions kiln should be run with as high rpm as possible. Higher kiln rpm improves clinker mineralogy and grindability.

## Modeling of Rotary Kiln in Cement Industry
Cement production is a highly energy-intensive process and the rotary kiln is the most important part of the process. Having a comprehensive model of the kiln in order to reduce manufacturing costs better performance can be created. In this paper the influence processes in a simulated cement rotary kiln and operating parameters on the output of the study were to develop and validate the

## Cement Kilns: Design features of rotary kilns
The bricks for cement kilns have to be made in a special tapered form in order to fit the curvature of the kiln shell. The iron and steel industries had prompted the production of refractories with a wide range of sophistied chemistries but it took some time for rotary cement production to increase to the stage at which these ideas were
