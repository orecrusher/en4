## Estimating the lump to fines composition split in iron ore 
Iron ore is mined crushed and separated into lump and fines components which are sold as separate products. Quality (and therefore value) depends upon the shipped composition of each product matching a target composition vector in iron and in several other minerals. Each day ore is selected for mining to meet these target grades.
