## Silica gel 
Silica gel is an amorphous and porous form of silicon dioxide (silica) consisting of an irregular tridimensional framework of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms with nanometer-scale voids and pores.The voids may contain water or some other liquids or may be filled by gas or vacuum.In the last case the material is properly called silica xerogel.
