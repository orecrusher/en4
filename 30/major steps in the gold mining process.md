## How Gold Is Mined 
The lifecycle of a gold mine. People in hard hats working underground is what often comes to mind when thinking about how gold is mined. Yet mining the ore is just one stage in a long and complex gold mining process. Long before any gold can be extracted significant exploration and development needs to take place both to determine as accurately as possible the size of the deposit as well

## Extracting Gold 
To isolate pure gold mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.

## Gold Refining 
 · The Miller process is rapid and simple but it produces gold of only about 99.5 percent purity. The Wohlwill process increases purity to about 99.99 percent by electrolysis. In this process a casting of impure gold is lowered into an electrolyte solution of hydrochloric acid and gold chloride.

## What are the main methods of mining? 
There are four main mining methods: underground open surface (pit) placer and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits. Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits. Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels beach sands or other environments.

Today however we begin a reclamation process of the empty mine. The goal of these projects is to try to return the mine to its natural state at least as much as possible. This is the final and perhaps the most important step to gold mining as we attempt to ensure that we leave as few permanent scars on the natural landscape as possible.

## How gold is made 
Gold recognizable by its yellowish cast is one of the oldest metals used by humans. As far back as the Neolithic period humans have collected gold from stream beds and the actual mining of gold can be traced as far back as 3500 B.C. when early Egyptians (the Sumerian culture of Mesopotamia) used mined gold to craft elaborate jewelry religious artifacts and utensils such as goblets.

Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g. 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified. In this case they are merely shattered by explosives and then piled into
