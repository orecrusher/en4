Today's quarries still employ the use of the wire saw in their operations. After the rock was pulled from the bed it was split across the grain and lifted from its place in the bed by teams of men with long metal bars. The giant slab was then hoisted precariously to the top of the quarry in a chain sling a dangerous but necessary operation.
