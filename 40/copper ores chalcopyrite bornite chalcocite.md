Bornite is an important copper ore mineral. It ranks up there with many of the other copper ores such as chalcocite chalcopyrite covellite digenite cuprite and tetrahedrite. As a mineral specimen bornite is usually lacking. Good crystals are rare and thus bornite is commonly known as simply a massive mineral ore. Also called "peacock ore".
