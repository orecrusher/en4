Copper refining to an almost pure state done by electrolysis is an excellent example of the process. Blister copper is considered to be a highly pure form of copper - around 99%. However in today's market this level of purity is still not enough; as a result the blister copper is purified further using an electrolysis process known as electrolytic refining.

The process of liberation of copper ores depends upon whether they are oxide or sulfide ores. Subsequent steps depend on the nature of the ore containing the copper. For oxide ores a hydrometallurgical liberation process is normally undertaken which uses the soluble nature of the ore minerals to the advantage of the metallurgical treatment plant.

Despite this early production most copper used in the United States was imported from Chile until 1844 when mining of large deposits of high-grade copper ore around Lake Superior began. The development of more efficient processing techniques in the late-1800s allowed the mining of lower-grade copper ores from huge open-pit mines in the western United States.

## How is Copper Made? 
 · The most common copper ores—there are about 15 of them mined in 40 countries— are sulfide ores where the copper has bonded chemically with sulfur. Sometimes copper ores contain gold silver or nickel although in minute quantities. Copper ores extracted from mines in the United States typically contain about 1.2-1.6% copper by weight.

## Mining Technology in the Nineteenth Century 
Miners used mechanical crushing and grinding machines to break up ores for further processing. Early miners used Mexican arrastras or stamp mills which reached their peak in the late nineteenth century to crush ores into sand-size particles. Before going to stamp mills ores often went through rock crushers which were like nutcrackers.

 · While ore grades vary widely copper ores typically contain only about a half-percent by weight of the element itself: thus roughly 200 tons of ore are dug up moved crushed and processed to get to one ton of copper. For rare earths some 20 to 160 tons of ore are mined per ton of element.
