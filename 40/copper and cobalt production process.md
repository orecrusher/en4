## APPLICATION OF SOLVENT
The concentrations of copper and zinc in a cobalt advance electrolyte can vary between 50 and 200 mg/L while the cobalt concentration can vary between 15 and 50 g/L depending on the design of the electrowinning circuit. The cobalt concentration is thus orders of magnitude higher than those of the zinc and copper.

Copper added to a standard diet often effects a moderate increase in hemoglobin production in anemia due to blood loss. The copper response is quite irregular in contrast to the iron response. In these dogs there is no lack of copper held in reserve stores (liver and spleen) so the reaction is not related to an actual deficiency of the element.
