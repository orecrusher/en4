## LARGE SCALE SLOPE STABILITY IN OPEN PIT MINING A REVIEW
open pits continuously increase. Small changes in the overall pit slope angle have large consequences on the overall economy of the mining operation. A case in particular is the Aitik open pit mine in northern Sweden which currently faces the design of the overall slope angles for continued mining toward a depth of around 500 meters.
