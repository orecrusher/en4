In thickener design there are two specifiions that will define the tank efficiency to process minerals: thickener area and drive torque. These specifiions commonly have high variability and are required to adjust to the programmed processing tonnages during the life of the mining project.

How a Thickener Works - Mineral Processing Metallurgy. Thickening or dewatering may be defined as the removal of a portion of the liquid from a pulp or slime made up of a mixture of finely divided solids and liquids. The early methods of thickening employed plain flat-bottomed tanks into which the pulp was fed until the tank was full.

Thickening and Clarifiion. Introduction. Thickeners are used in continuous process appliions where liquid-solid separation by sedimentation is involved. Thickeners have three basic purposes: Concentration or raising the density of a mixture of solids and liquids (feed slurry). Clarifiion which involves removing solids from the mixture.
