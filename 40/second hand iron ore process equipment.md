## Process 
As the iron travels down the molding line the temperature gradually decreases from about 1200 to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. Temperature at this stage varies based on the size of the casting as well as the molding rate. At the end of the mold line castings enter a shakeout process where the molds are shaken off and the sand is recycled for reuse.
