## operation of a milling machine 
Milling Machine: Milling is one of the types of cutting machine which is used for various types of operations on it. The milling machine is operated with the help of an electric motor which is connected to a spindle of the cutting tool to produce high rotational speed to remove the extra material from work. on this type of machine we can work on small parts and large parts.

## Milling Machine: Operational Principle of Milling Machine
 · A milling machine is a machine tool used for the shaping of metal and other solid materials. Its basic form is that of a rotating cutter which rotates about the spindle axis and a table to which the workpiece is affixed. Milling operation involves movement of the rotating cutter sideways as well as 'in and out'.

 · Introduction: Milling is the cutting operation that removes metal by feeding the work against a rotating cutter having single or multiple cutting edges. Flat or curved surfaces of many shapes can be machined by milling with good finish and accuracy. A milling machine may also be used for drilling slotting making a circular profile and gear cutting by having suitable attachments.
