## The Difference between a Horizontal and Vertical Milling 
Oct 30 2019 · Vertical milling machines come in at least two main varieties. On turret mills the spindle is fixed in place; the bed of the mill however can move and rotate. For smaller pieces this gives a wide range of flexibility particularly when boring cavities into a workpiece – such as when creating molds.

## The Grist Milling Process 
The miller and his helpers had little time to loaf in the course of their work day. When grain arrived in a cart or wagon or in a sack slung over a horse they had to hook a rope to it and haul it to the top floor of the mill. This was a hand-over-hand job in many small mills with only a single pulley to help.

## Ring Mills
Vertical and Horizontal Mills: Radial ring mills have traditionally been constructed as "vertical mills" or "horizontal mills". It is often a matter of preference to material handling. Horizontal mills add some additional expense much of it in using a vertical output shaft gearbox for the main work roll drive.

On Vertical Mills the 4th Axis is frequently parallel to X or Y and is laid down. On a Horizontal Mill the 4th Axis is also parallel to X or Y but it is standing up. Both methods work great but the horizontal mill's standing 4th axis frequently has more clearance available since the work is never trapped between the table and the axis.
