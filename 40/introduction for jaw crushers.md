## Jaw Crusher Explained 
A jaw crusher uses compressive force for breaking ore pieces. Compressive force is applied by two jaws (dies) one of the crusher jaws is stationary (fixed jaw) whilst the other is moving (swing jaw). Material is fed into the top feed opening (gape) and gradually moves downwards towards the lower discharge outlet.
