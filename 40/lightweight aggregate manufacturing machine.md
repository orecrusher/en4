Our lightweight aggregates from Lytag® are made from fly ash generated by coal fired power stations. Our technology heats the fly ash to 1100°C to create a hard pellet with a honeycombed internal structure. Which can then be used as a superior lightweight aggregate which is up to 50% lighter than natural aggregate.
