The end mill speed is calculated with the following formula: n [rpm] = (vc [m/min] 1000) / 3.14  ø d1 [mm]) Example calculation: vc = 500 m/min (selected from chart) d = ø 8 mm 19904 rpm = (500 1000) / (3.14  8). If the maximum speed of the milling motor is lower than the calculated value the maximum speed of the milling motor needs to be inserted into the formula for the feed calculation.
