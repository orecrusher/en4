## VANADIUM 
 · In fact in most cases vanadium is produced as a co-product of some other element most commonly iron but also uranium and phosphorus and in the pest lead and zinc. In most extraction methods the vanadium becomes concentrated in a slag from which it may be recovered. The principal ore deposits of vanadium occur in titaniferous

Characterization of the ore and examination of the beneficiation methods considered in earlier studies led to the development of a new approach the aim of which is to separate a Ti-richer fraction for primary ilmenite recovery.
