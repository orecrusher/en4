Calculation of the power draw of dry multi-compartment ball mills 225 The mill load that is the volume of charge in the mill is the principal determinant of power draw. Estimation of the ball load that is mixed with the cement charge is difficult and can be highly erroneous. So direct measurement must be taken for calculation of mill load.
