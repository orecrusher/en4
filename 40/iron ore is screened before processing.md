Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

## Smelting 
Smelting is an energy-intensive process used to refine an ore into usable metal. Most ore deposits contain metals in the reacted or combined form. Magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) hematite (Fe 2 O 3) goethite (αFeO[OH]) limonite (the generic formula for limonite is FeO[OH].nH 2 O) and siderite (FeCO 3) are iron ores and Cu 5 FeSO 4 is a copper ore.

Screening usually follows after comminution. The aim of this experiment was to screen and sieve haematite ore and to study its particle size distribution. The screening was done using an industrial screen and the sieving was done using laboratory Tyler sieves. The initial mass of the ore manually fed to the screen was 11.965 kg.
