The reading on the pressure gauge will allow for an accurate calculation of volumetric flow rates to the hydrocyclone which will make it possible to calculate the mass flow rate. Lower cyclone pressure results in inefficiencies while high pressure increases the centrifugal force beyond its design specifiions which increases cyclone wear rate.
