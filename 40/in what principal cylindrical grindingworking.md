## Cylinder stress 
In mechanics a cylinder stress is a stress distribution with rotational symmetry; that is which remains unchanged if the stressed object is rotated about some fixed axis.. Cylinder stress patterns include: circumferential stress or hoop stress a normal stress in the tangential direction.; axial stress a normal stress parallel to the axis of cylindrical symmetry.
