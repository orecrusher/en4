## Crushing in Mineral Processing
 · In mineral processing or metallurgy the first stage of comminution is crushing.. Depending of the type of rock (geometallurgy) to be crushed there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks. In principle compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear-resistant plate/surface.

Crushed stone is an angular form of construction aggregate made by breaking quarried rock into fragments that may be sorted sized and recombined into a variety of products. Crushed stone is typically quarried—that is mined using benching methods (carrying out work from a ledge in a mine or quarry) and explosives as opposed to the mechanical digging used for extracting sand and gravel

Rock crushers are machine build to break large rocks into much smaller rocks gravel or sometimes rock dust. They are an important tool for most commercial mining operations. Rock crushers usually hold the rocks to be crushed in between two solid surfaces and apply a force that forces the molecule of the materials to separate or change alignment.
