## Combining solar power with coal
 · Operators of coal-fired power plants seek ways to increase the efficiency and extend the working lives of their plants by improving the operational flexibility and reducing the environmental impact. Two possible options are explored: combining solar energy with coal-fired power generation and cofiring natural gas in coal-fired power plants.

 · A coal-fired plant is consuming thousands of tons of coal every day. Sitting outside the typical plant is a million-ton stockpile of coal that might keep the plant supplied for a month or two. Trains and barges are arriving every day delivering the coal the plant needs. The first step in turning the coal into electricity is a pulverizer.

## How a Coal Plant Works 
How a Coal Plant Works. Coal-fired plants produce electricity by burning coal in a boiler to produce steam. The steam produced under tremendous pressure flows into a turbine which spins a generator to create electricity. The steam is then cooled condensed back into water and returned to the boiler to start the process over.

 · Coal-fired power plants using pulverized coal or lignite as fuel generate large quantities of fly-ash as a by-product. With the increase in commissioning of several super thermal power plants with large capacity and with the increasing use of low grade coal of high ash content the amount of generation of ash from them is becoming very large.

## Coal
 · A coal-fired power station is an energy plant that burns coal – a fossil fuel – to generate electricity that's fed into the grid which supplies power to homes and businesses. There are a few key energies stored in coal and when successfully converted can create thermal energy mechanical energy and electrical energy.

## How a Coal Plant Works 
Coal-fired plants produce electricity by burning coal in a boiler to produce steam. The steam produced under tremendous pressure flows into a turbine which spins a generator to create electricity. The steam is then cooled condensed back into water and returned to the boiler to start the process over.
