## Factors Affecting Strength of Concrete 
A lower water cement ratio means less water or more cement and lower workability. However if the workability becomes too low the concrete becomes difficult to compact and the strength reduces. For a given set of materials and environment conditions the strength at any age depends only on the water-cement ratio providing full compaction can

Water reducers are used to reduce the amount of water required to produce a given slump. They also provide a ball bearing effect making the concrete easier to finish and produce better cement hydration. By reducing the amount of water required cement amounts can be reduced because concrete strength is directly related to the water/cement ratio.
