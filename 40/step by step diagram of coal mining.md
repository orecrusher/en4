## How is coal formed?
 · Coal formed millions of years ago when the earth was covered with huge swampy forests where plants - giant ferns reeds and mosses - grew. As the plants grew some died and fell into the swamp waters. New plants grew up to take their places and when these died still more grew. In time there was thick layer of dead plants rotting in the swamp.
