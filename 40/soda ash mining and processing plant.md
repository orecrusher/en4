## Manufacturing Process 
Soda Ash is only obtained from mining an ore called trona or through the Solvay process. Trona ore is mined at 1500 feet below the surface. Since the Solvay process causes alot of pollution Mining trona is the more efficient way of getting this soda ash even though this way it is much harder to obtain.
