## Ethox 4804 
In the recovery of gold a cyanide solution is evenly distributed across the top of the heap. The issue is the flow of the solution quickly slows due to the ores natural composition. This creates an extended leaching process adding to operating costs and reducing the amount of gold recovered. Ethox 4804 is the answer to these costly problems.

## Extracting Gold 
Leaching dissolves the gold out of the ore using a chemical solvent. The most common solvent is cyanide which must be combined with oxygen in a process known as carbon-in-pulp. As the cyanide and oxygen react chemically gold in the pulp dissolves. When workers introduce small carbon grains to the tank the gold adheres to the carbon.
