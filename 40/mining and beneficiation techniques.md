## New Techniques in Beneficiation of the Florida Phosphates 
Lower ore grades increasing power costs and environmental regulations are necessitating development of new concepts of mining and matrix transportation. Because one of the ores to be mined in the future contains appreciable amounts of dolomite research and development efforts are being concentrated on new techniques in beneficiation.

## Mining Mineral Processing 
Mining and mineral beneficiation plays a pivotal part in South Africa's economy. The country's mineral reserves are among the most valuable in the world. South Africa has the world's largest reserves of platinum group metals (PGMs) and manganese and some of the largest gold diamonds chromite ore and vanadium deposits.

## What is Beneficiation? 
The goal of beneficiation is to eliminate inefficiency and waste by ensuring that as much recoverable material as possible is extracted from ore. A number of techniques can be used for this often starting with grinding the ore into particles. Once ground the particles can be sifted and sorted to extract usable material and set waste aside.

## Beneficiation 
In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals which results in a higher grade product (ore concentrate) and a waste stream ().There are many different types of beneficiation with each step furthering the concentration of the original ore.

## Beneficiation 
Mineral beneficiation is a process that seeks to improve the quality and value of ore by cleaning and purifying it. Impurities and other contents are separated to achieve a higher purity of the ore or coal and prepares it for further processing. Our mining services in the area of beneficiation include mineral processing and coal upgrading.
