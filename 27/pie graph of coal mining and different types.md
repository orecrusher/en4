## Coal Mining 
Coal mining operations generate a considerable amount of rocks (discarded mine stone) rejecting coal and fines that are produced during washing. These material excavation from the anoxic subsurface and transfer to the surface for the process. Residues from the mining contain various metals like Al Cu Fe Mn Pb Zn etc. (Silva et al. 2013).

## What are the different types of coal? 
The coal formation process involves the burial of peat which is made of partly decayed plant materials deep underground. The heat and pressure of burial alters the texture and increases the carbon content of the peat which transforms it into coal a type of sedimentary rock. This process takes millions of years. Types or "ranks" of coal are determined by carbon content.

## Coal Production 
Coal production continues to grow globally due to the demand for low cost energy and iron and steel as well as cement. Coal based on the current extraction rates will last about 115 years longer than conventional oil and gas reserves with an estimated 1.1 trillion tonnes of proven coal reserves worldwide. Ten countries are responsible for 90% of the total global coal production.
