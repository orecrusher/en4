## THE FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS OF IRON ORE REDUCTION
Thus the kinetics of iron ore reduction is an important fundamental aspect. The sponge iron processes differ from each other in the type of furnace used which may be a rotary kiln shaft furnace 'or fluidized bed reactor. They also differ in the type of fuels used These can be solid liquid or gaseous.

## How is iron ore reduced in the blast furnace 
 · How is iron ore reduced in the blast furnace? hii friend here is your answer Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron oxide. The oxygen must be removed from the iron oxide to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

 · The shaft furnace is where iron ore is converted to metallic. Iron oxide in pellet or lump form is introduced through a proportioning hopper at the top of the shaft furnace. As the iron ore descends through the furnace by gravity flow it is heated and the oxygen is removed from the iron ore (reduction) by counterflowing gases that have a high H ₂ and CO content.

 · Blast furnaces operate on the principle of chemical reduction whereby carbon monoxide having a stronger affinity for the oxygen in iron ore than iron does reduces the iron to its elemental form. Flue gas is in direct contact with the ore and iron allowing carbon monoxide to diffuse into the ore and reduce the iron oxide to elemental iron mixed with carbon.
