## Extraction of Iron Concentration of Ore 
 · The extraction of iron from its ore is the third and the penultimate process in metallurgy which is the process of separating metals from their ores. The common ores of iron are iron oxides. These oxides can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. Heating coal in the absence of air produces coke.

## Iron Extraction by Blast Furnace Metallurgy 
Iron when extracted from iron ore such as haematite containing iron (III) oxide Fe2O3 in a blast furnace is called iron extraction blast furnace metallurgy. In this reduction reaction oxygen is removed from the iron (III) oxide to leave behind iron. Generally the extraction of metals and their isolation are based on three major procedures.
