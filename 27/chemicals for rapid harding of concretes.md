## Carbonation of concrete
Carbonation is a slow and continuous process that progresses from the outer surface moving inwards. Over the lifecycle of concrete carbonation will result in the reabsorption of around a third of the CO2 emitted when making cement significantly reducing the whole-life CO2 footprint of both the cement and the concrete for which it is used.

Corrosion Resistance of Concrete. Corrosion of this rebar caused spalling on a concrete step. The corrosion of reinforcing steel can be a problem in concrete structures. Corrosion of steel produces hydrated iron oxide or rust which is very expansive. This expansion builds up internal pressure until the concrete fails in the form of spalling.
