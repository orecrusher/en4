## What Is Iron Ore Beneficiation? (with pictures)
Iron ore is smelted after going through beneficiation. The iron ore industry classifies the material by the concentration of the metal that is present after iron ore beneficiation has been completed. High-grade iron ore must have a concentration of 65% iron or higher and medium grade of 62% to 65%.
