 · At current gold prices this is worth about US$600. Both smelter treatment charges and oxidation or bio-leach costs are at least $200/t of concentrate and payables/recovery in the 90% range so a minimum GSR for effective downstream processing is around 0.5. Clearly this is a function of gold price but in the current gold price and cost

## Extracting Gold 
To isolate pure gold mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.

## Gold Processing 
 · Gold flotation. Flotation process is widely used for lode gold processing. In most cases the flotation method has a good effect in sulfide-containing gold ore with high floatability. In addition the flotation process is also used for polymetallic gold-bearing ores such as gold-copper gold-lead gold-copper-lead-zinc-sulfur ore.

Past producing gold mines leave behind high grades of above-surface gold. This allows AMG to start processing gold immediately without traditional underground mining. A century ago technology price points weren't available to process that gold effectively. Today these gold grades are often some of the best in the world.
