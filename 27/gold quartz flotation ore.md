## Flotation of Iron Oxides and Quartz—A Review: Mineral 
Froth flotation of iron oxides and quartz is reviewed over the broad range of particle sizes. The review which embraces laboratory- pilot plant- and industrial operations encompasses (i) surface chemistry of iron oxides and quartz flotation (ii) relevant collectors and their adsorption mechanism and (iii) activation/depression in selective flotation in this system.

 · (1) It's difficult to use flotation process for extraction of coarse-grained gold ore especially when the gold grain is larger than 0.2mm. (2) For ore hard to reach the flotation conditions such as quartz-bearing gold ore without sulfides it is difficult to obtain stable flotation foam after slurring.

## Quartz vein type gold ore and sulfide gold oregold ore 
 · When the ore has good floatability the flotation of quartz-containing gold ore can produce tailings that are similar to the cyanidation process. The flotation tailings are ground and then floated which can increase the flotation recovery rate. In most cases the cyanide method is more commonly used in quartz vein type gold ore.
