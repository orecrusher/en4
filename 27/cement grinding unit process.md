## Modern Processing Techniques to minimize cost in Cement 
Grinding is a highly energy intensive process in the cement industry. Approximately 60 – 70 % of the total electrical ene rgy used in a cement plant is utilised for the grinding of raw materials coal and clinker. Various technological improvements from the conventional ball mills in this area include:

## Manufacturing process 
The raw mix is fed into a circular storage unit called a raw mix storage. Then the mix is extracted transversely from the stockpile by reclaimers and conveyed to a raw mill bin called the raw mix bin for grinding. The other raw materials that are used in cement manufacturing called additives are high purity limestone sand and iron ore.

## Best energy consumption 
 · Grinding energy was approximately 50 per cent of the ball mill and the drying capabilities allowed direct processing of materials of up to 20 per cent moisture content. The main energy issue was the high power consumption of mill fans with pressure drops of 100mbar not uncommon with high nozzle ring velocities (>70m/s) and internal mill circulating loads of >1000 per cent.
