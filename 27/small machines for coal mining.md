## Coal Mines in the Industrial Revolution 
Coal mines in the Industrial Revolution were deeper than ever before. Before the 18th century coal was mined from shallow mines. However as the Industrial Revolution gained speed demand for fuel rapidly increased. Before the Industrial Revolution there were two different types of mines: bell pits and drift mines.

## Cutting Machines 
Cutting Machines - Shearers. Shearers are by far the most commonly used cutting machines both in Australia and overseas. A shearer consists of a machine body containing electric motors hydraulic equipment and controls which is mounted over the AFC. Horizontal cutting drums are mounted on the face side of the machine laced with cutting picks

## Continuous miners 
In machines which covered the full face steering in the vertical plane could also be a major difficulty. The term "continuous" as applied to development machines has been one of the biggest misnomers used for mining equipment because on development they are usually anything but continuously cutting.

Longwall mining machines are about 800 feet (240 meters) in width and 5 to 10 feet (1.5 to 3 meters) tall. Longwall miners extract "panels" - rectangular blocks of coal as wide as the mining machinery and as long as 12000 feet (3650 meters). Massive shearers cut coal from a wall face which falls onto a conveyor belt for removal.

## Causes Effects and Solutions for Mining 
For mining purposes big machines are often used in order to make the mining process more effective and to reduce the physical work for miners. However these machines emit large amounts of harmful gases also including greenhouse gases like methane or CO2. Thus mining can also cause air pollution and the implied consequences.

Coal mines operated without electricity. Electricity began to be adopted in mining and manufacturing in the late 1880s and the 1890s. (Electricity was first introduced into Ohio's bituminous coal mines in 1889.) The introduction of electricity in coal mines greatly facilitated the introduction of laborsaving machinery

## Continuous Miner 
 · Continuous Miner:- A continuous miner is a mining machine that produces a constant flow of ore from the working face of the mine. The machine continuously extracts as it is loading coal with a cutting steel drum and conveyor system. Continuous miners are typically used in room and pillar mining operations. The continuous miner is different from conventional or cyclical mining

A continuous miner was then utilised to cut 3.5m wide open ended lifts off the face with shuttle cars being used to transport coal along and off the face to the maingate belt in lieu of an AFC. The face length was therefore limited by the length of shuttle car cables then available but in practice most shortwall faces were considerably shorter than this (<90m).

Miners travel by elevator down a mine shaft to reach the depths of the mine and operate heavy machinery that extracts the coal and moves it above ground. The immediate environmental impact of underground mining appears less dramatic than surface mining. There is little overburden but underground mining operations leave significant tailings.
