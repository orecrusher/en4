## Phosphorus 
Phosphorus is a vital component of DNA the genetic "memory unit" of all living things. It is also a component of RNA the compound that reads the DNA genetic code to build proteins and other compounds essential for plant structure seed yield and genetic transfer. The structures of both DNA and RNA are linked together by phosphorus bonds.
