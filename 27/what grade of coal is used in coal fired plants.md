## New procedure to reduce pollution from coal
 · Typically coal power plants release a lot of carbon dioxide (CO2) that is a dangerous greenhouse gas. The varieties of coal found in India have an additional problem. They have high ash content. Burning coal in the conventional pulverised mode results in the release of a lot of fly ash a major contributor to air pollution and a health hazard.

## Coal
Coal-fired boilers are mainly operated at either subcritical or supercritical conditions. From a thermo-physics perspective two phase mixtures of water and steam are replaced by a single supercritical fluid when the boiler pressure increases above the critical pressure of 22.12 MPa and the corresponding saturation temperature of 374 °C (Shen and Cheng 2004).

percent of our electricity comes from coal-fired power plants. Coal Mining Coal companies use two methods to mine coal: surface mining and underground mining. Surface mining is used to extract about one-third of the coal in the United States. Surface mining can be used when the coal is buried less than 200 feet underground.

## Coal facts 
Coal facts. Coal is an organically derived material. It is formed from the remains of decayed plant material compacted into a solid through millions of years of chemical changes under pressure and heat. Its rich carbon content gives coal most of its energy content. When coal is burned in the presence of air or oxygen heat energy is released.

A coal fired power plant with a yield of 33% (which is the world average for these plants) will use roughly 400 kg of coal to produce one electric MWh. If ashes represent 20% of the incoming weight we will get roughly 80 kg of ashes. 1 TWh électrique (one million MWh or one billion kWh) means 400000 tonnes of coal used and 80000 tonnes of ashes at the end.

However burning coal in electric power plants is a major source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and its use has other repercussions as well. Mining coal disturbs the land and modifies the chemistry of rainwater runoff which in turn affects stream and river water quality.

 · Coal trader's web sites give base prices in the international market. We take a coal price of around 65 $ / Ton. The cost of coal consumed by 100 MW power plant is (53.8 x 65) 3497 $ /hr. A 100 MW unit produces 100000 units of electricity. So the cost of coal per unit of electricity is (3497/100000) 3.5 cents per unit.

Coal is a sedimentary rock that is formed from the remains of plants found mainly in underground deposits. This hard black rock is mostly made up of carbon and also contains sulfur hydrogen nitrogen and oxygen. Coal forms from the accumulation of plant debris mostly in a swamp environment. When a plant dies and falls into a swamp the water of the swamp protects it from decaying.
