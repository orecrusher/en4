## Standard Test Methods for Chemical Analysis of Glass Sand
Scope. 1.1 These test methods cover the chemical analysis of glass sands. They are useful for either high-silica sands (99 % + silica (SiO 2 )) or for high-alumina sands containing as much as 12 to 13 % alumina (Al 2 O 3 ). Generally nonclassical the test methods are rapid and accurate. They include the determination of silica and of total R 2

## Why We Use Joint Sand Stabilizer when Paver Sealing
 · Before you use your new paver patio or driveway it's important to make sure it is protected so you can enjoy it for years to come. After investing in a new paver patio or driveway we recommend joint stabilizing silica sand and sealer. This is a combination of using joint stabilizing silica sand and a liquid product that protects and penetrates both the paver and the sand in the joint as well.
