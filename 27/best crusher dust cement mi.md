## House path: Concrete VS Rock?? 
Â Â· Compacted crusher dust or roadbase is perfectly adequate for a perimeter path â and if you mix cement in with it (14x20kg bags per cubic metre of roadbase/crusher dust makes a pretty good "concrete") and thoroughly compact it it will draw in ground moisture and set hard anyway.

## Compacting crusher dust 
Â Â· When I asked a landscaper to complete this task he claims that compacting the crusher dust on top will cause the sewer pipe to crack. It is my understanding that old terracotta pipes are laid about 600mm below surface. He said that its better to lay pavers on top of this area. I definitely would not want to concrete the area nor turf it.

## The Complete Guide to Crushed Stone and Gravel 
Â Â· Crushed stone: If you hear the generic "crushed stone" term it usually refers to stone that has a mixture of stone dust in it. This type of stone is best used for a base when heavy compaction is needed. As a result it is typically used for the base of concrete and paving projects foundations of structures and driveway bases.
