 · When I asked a landscaper to complete this task he claims that compacting the crusher dust on top will cause the sewer pipe to crack. It is my understanding that old terracotta pipes are laid about 600mm below surface. He said that its better to lay pavers on top of this area. I definitely would not want to concrete the area nor turf it.
