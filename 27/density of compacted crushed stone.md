Crushed stone dust or natural sand is the fine aggregate chiefly utilised in the concrete mix. Sand may be collected from the river sea lake or pit. Still when used in the concrete mix it should be adequately cleaned and tested to determine that the total percentage of silt salts clay and other such organic stuff does not pass the defined limit.

 · The densities of rocks and minerals are normally expressed as specific gravity which is the density of the rock relative to the density of water. This isn't as complex as you may think because water's density is 1 gram per cubic centimeter or 1 g/cm 3. Therefore these numbers translate directly to g/cm 3 or tonnes per cubic meter (t/m 3).
