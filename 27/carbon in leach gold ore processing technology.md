## Gold CIL CIP Gold Leaching Process Explained CCD
 · Carbon-in leach (CIL) is a simultaneous leach and absorption process. The simultaneous leach and absorption phases of the CIL process were developed for processing gold ores that contain preg-robbing materials such as natural absorptive carbon. These reduce the gold yield by attracting gold meant for the activated carbon.
