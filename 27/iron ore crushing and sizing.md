During ore dressing the crude ore is reduced in size to a point where each mineral grain becomes essentially free so as to make separation between them. Such a phenomenon of making the mineral grains free from gangue in an ore is termed as liberation. This is practically carried out by size reduction performed by crushers and grinding mills.

Crushing and grinding are the two primary comminution processes. Crushing is normally carried out on "run-of-mine" ore while grinding (normally carried out after crushing) may be conducted on dry or slurried material. In comminution the size reduction of particles is done by three types of forces: compression impact and attrition.
