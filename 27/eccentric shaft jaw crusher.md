## Eccentric Shaft 
Figure 8.1 shows two basic types of jaw crushers: single toggle and double toggle. In the single toggle jaw crusher an eccentric shaft is installed on the top of the crusher. Shaft rotation causes along with the toggle plate a compressive action of the moving jaw. A double toggle crusher has basically two shafts and two toggle plates.

## What is the eccentric throw? — SRP
The eccentric throw is one of the most important parameters in defining the job that your cone crusher does. The mantle in a cone crusher spins in conical pendulum motion. That means it doesn't stay in the center of the chamber – it sweeps around moving closer and further away from the concave. This is what creates the crushing action.

Such known crushers (e. g. manufactured by Kennedy Van Saun Iowa Manufacturing Co. and others) consist of a stationary jaw and a swing jaw mounted directly on the eccentric shaft so that it receives downward and forward motions. The lower end of the swing jaw is held in position against the toggle by a tension rod.
