EcoGlobal plans for second production plant - Recycling Today. Sep 01 2014· The production of recycled coarse aggregate implies generating large amounts of fines – a minimum fraction of 35–40%. As Fig. 2 shows the generation of fines increases with a reduction in porosity of the recycled coarse aggregate which is an increase in quality.
