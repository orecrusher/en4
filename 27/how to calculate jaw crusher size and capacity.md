## What is the eccentric throw? — SRP 
The eccentric throw is one of the most important parameters in defining the job that your cone crusher does. The mantle in a cone crusher spins in conical pendulum motion. That means it doesn't stay in the center of the chamber – it sweeps around moving closer and further away from the concave. This is what creates the crushing action.

## Tips to maximize crushing efficiency 
 · Setting jaw crushers. Ideally the reduction ratio of a jaw crusher should be 6-to-1. There are different ways to calculate reduction ratio but the best way is something called the P80 factor. The reduction ratio is then calculated by comparing the input feed size passing 80 percent versus the discharge size that passes 80 percent.
