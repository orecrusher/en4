Coal fines are usually prepared by air swept coal mill or vertical mill. In order to produce high-quality clinker the fineness of coal fines should be controlled at about 12% and its moisture content should be controlled within 1.0%. The machines that are usually used to dry the coal fines are rotary dryers.

## How does coke and coal play into steel making? 
 · It is produced by baking coal until it becomes carbon by burning off impurities without burning up the coal itself. When coke is consumed it generates intense heat but little smoke making it ideal for smelting iron and steel. Prior to the 1880's steel was produced using charcoal. By 1920 nearly 90% of US steel was produced using coke.
