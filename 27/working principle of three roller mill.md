Vertical Roller Mill Structure And Working Principle. WORKING PRINCIPLE. The motor drives the grinding table through decelerator. The materials fall down the center of grinding table from feed opening. At the same time hot air comes into the mill from the air inlet. Due to the centrifugal force materials move to the edge of the grinding table.

The Sheet Metal Rolling Machine works according to the principle of three point bending. The rotation of the driven rolls being utilized to feed the metal through the rolls by means of the frictional forces present between the surface of the rolls and sheet. No lubricant is used at its presence interference with the ability to grip.
