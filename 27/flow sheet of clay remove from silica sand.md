## How is Silicone Made? 
 · Isolating silicon from silica is the first step in the production of silicone. This is done by heating a large volume of quartz sand to temperatures as high as 1800˚C. The result is pure isolated silicon which is allowed to cool and then ground into a fine powder. To make silicone this fine silicon powder is combined with methyl chloride
