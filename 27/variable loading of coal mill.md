## COAL HANDLING SAFETY 
COAL HANDLING SAFETY Risks of unwanted combustion – potentially causing injury damage and downtime – occur everywhere that coal is handled processed or stored. Safe coal handling practices are designed to ensure that the fuel remains intact throughout its journey from the mine until the point at which it is ignited in the boiler.

 · To use the rifle or pistol as a repeater one will need to keep overall cartridge length within these parameters. However accuracy can often be improved by tailoring the COAL to best fit your chamber. This length may exceed the standard "magazine" COAL for repeaters and require single-loading of each cartridge for the finest accuracy.

To summarize the coal mill controls they may be divided basically into two major egories:. 1. To control the quality of coal being sent to the burners loed on the furnace walls. The word quality here means the temperature and fineness of the PF. The set temperature values are dependent on the percentage of volatile matter that exists in the main fuel.
