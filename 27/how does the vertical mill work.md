Turning on the milling machine. In the same way that it is possible to mill on a lathe by using a vertical slide it is possible to use a milling machine to turn. The difference is that one might use the lathe to mill not because it is done better than on a milling machine but only because the user does not have a milling machine.

Kirsten C. Tynan Modern CNC machines may utilize three or more milling spindles in order to manufacture more products at one time. The main rotating component of a milling machine that transfers power to the cutting tool is called a milling spindle. Milling is a machining process in which a work piece is moved relative to a rotating tool with cutting edges in order to remove material.

## An Overview of Vertical vs. Horizontal Milling 
 · Vertical milling is an excellent choice for projects mostly worked on a single side such as sinking dies and working with large metal plates. In some cases vertical mills are simpler and less complex internally than horizontal mills because the spindle doesn't have to be geared to move in two directions. Some vertical milling projects are more affordable than those requiring horizontal milling.
