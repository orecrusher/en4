If the purpose is to refine all of the gold however this will be done on a much larger scale. The refiner takes either the sample or the entire portion of gold and mixes it in a crucible with a flux (soda or borax) and lead or silver. The flux lowers the melting temperature of gold making the process somewhat easier to complete and the lead

## video gold refine miller process 
The Miller process is an industrial-scale chemical procedure used to refine gold to a high degree of purity (99.5%). It was invented by Francis Bowyer Miller (patented 1867). This chemical process involves blowing a stream of pure chlorine gas over and through a crucible filled with molten but impure gold.
