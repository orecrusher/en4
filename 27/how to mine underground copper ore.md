## Copper Mining and Extraction Sulfide Ores
Copper can be extracted from its ore by: Underground: sinking a vertical shaft into the Earth to an appropriate depth and driving horizontal tunnels into the ore. Open pit: 90% of ore is mined by this method. Ores near the surface can be quarried after removal of the surface layers. The ore

## Digging deeper: Mining methods explained 
Underground mining is used to extract ore from below the surface of the earth safely economically and with as little waste as possible. The entry from the surface to an underground mine may be through a horizontal or vertical tunnel known as an adit shaft or decline. Underground mining is practical when: The ore body is too deep to mine

 · Underground mining starts by following a surface outcrop of mineral ore as it slopes into the ground. The ore could be just 20 feet below the surface. Shaft mines are the deepest underground mines. South African gold mines are 12000 feet underground. Access to underground mines is usually via a sloping or vertical shaft with an elevator mechanism.

## Underground Mining for Ore 
By contrast underground mining produces minimal waste. But it's more costly because the equipment is much smaller than the equipment used in for example open-pit mining. Usually however the quality of the mined ore offsets these costs.

## Copper extraction 
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source local environmental regulations and other factors.. As in all mining operations the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

## Copper Mining and Extraction: Oxide Ores
Copper is refined from ores in the ground either through underground or open-pit mines. Most of the copper ores mined today are oxide or sulfide ores. Extraction of sulfide ores is covered in more detail in Copper Mining and Extraction: Sulfide Ores (11–14) but is introduced here because an important by-product of this process is used for the extraction of oxide ores.

## Will copper ores spawn in already loaded chunks?
 · 3 replies. You will have to venture far to find unloaded chunks. New updated blocks don't generate in pre existing chunks you will have to find unloaded chunks to find deepslate copper and geodes. if unlucky if you have a mine with a chest a copper might spawn there and RUIN YOUR LIFE! if its like mobs i guess they could spawn.

## How to Process Copper Ore: Beneficiation Methods and 
 · Copper ore beneficiation methods. Before the beneficiation of copper ores crushing and grinding are required. The bulk ores are crushed to about 12cm by a jaw crusher or a cone crusher. Then the crushed materials are sent to the grinding equipment and the final particle size of the copper ore is reduced to 0.15-0.2mm.
