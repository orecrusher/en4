## Ball Mill: Operating principles components Uses 
 · A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis. The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 – 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.

Ball mills can be designed to operate continuously (fed at one end of the system and discharged at the other) or on a batch basis for smaller or intermittent volumes. They can also be operated either on a stand-alone basis ('open-circuit grinding') or in conjunction with a classifier which returns oversize product to the mill for further grinding ('closed-circuit grinding').
