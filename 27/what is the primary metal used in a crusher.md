## How chalk is made 
Primary crushing such as in a jaw crusher breaks down large boulders; secondary crushing pulverizes smaller chunks into pebbles. The limestone is then wet-milled with water in a ball mill—a rotating steel drum with steel balls inside to further pulverize the chalk.

Primary Crushing As the first stage in a crushing circuit following extraction from a mine site (or in the case of recycled asphalt production delivery to the RAP processing plant via truck transport) primary crushing reduces material to a size and shape that can be handled by the secondary crusher. Typically the minimum setting on most primary crushers will be about 4 to 6 inches as noted above.

## Primary Crusher 
The primary crusher is loed in the quarry and consists of a McLanahan 48″x72′ Shale King Crusher rated at 1000 TPH (Tons Per Hour). The driving flywheel has a diameter of 2.5 meters and is motor driven through six v-belts. The capacity of the primary crusher had to be increased to 1250 TPH to produce enough material to serve the wet and both dry lines in the plant.

Steel products in-use today all contain a proportion of recycled steel from previous incarnations. This can be one or many previous uses. Originally all 'recycled' steel was produced from iron ore and therefore how the initial impacts of primary production are shared over subsequent uses of the same material is an important question in quantifying its whole life environmental impacts.

Hammermills are very similar to the impact crushers although they usually use only one rotor and the hammers are pivoted. It should be noted that these crushers cannot be used underground for primary crushers as they cannot handle any steel (i.e. Rockbolts drill steels). Table 6 lists the advantages and disadvantages of impact crushers.
