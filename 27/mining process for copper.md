SX-EW technology involves leaching (the process of dissolving useful ingredients with a solution) in atmospheric conditions of copper ore heaps by means of diluted sulphuric acid. Folowing leaching the pregnant leaching solution is transported via a drainage system to the next stage. In an SX-EW reactor the first process to take place is solvent extraction which involves

## copper processing 
 · Copper processing the extraction of copper from its ores and the preparation of copper metal or chemical compounds for use in various products.. In its pure form or as an alloy copper (Cu) is one of the most important metals in society. The pure metal has a face-centred cubic crystal structure and there is no critical temperature at which this crystal structure changes.

## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining Extraction
Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods. Underground mining is achieved by sinking shafts to the appropriate levels and then driving horizontal tunnels called adits to reach the ore. Underground mining is however relatively expensive and is generally limited to rich ores.

copper mining: surface and underground mining. Due to copper being spread in relatively low concentrations over large areas surface or open-pit mining is the predominant mining method for copper in the world. After mining copper is produced by one of two process routes: pyrometallurgical or hydrometallurgical.

## How copper is made 
Despite this early production most copper used in the United States was imported from Chile until 1844 when mining of large deposits of high-grade copper ore around Lake Superior began. The development of more efficient processing techniques in the late-1800s allowed the mining of lower-grade copper ores from huge open-pit mines in the western United States.

## Copper Mining and Extraction 
Copper is extracted in large amounts from the Earth's crust by mining of sulphide ores and also oxide ores. Studies reveal about 80% of copper is produced by its extraction from sulphide ores. Chalcopyrite is a certain kind of suphide ore that can be converted to copper by a different method from silie carbonate or sulphate ores.

The process of mining copper begins with drilling and blasting. Large drilling rigs bore a carefully designed pattern of holes approximately 12 inches in diameter and 60 feet deep into the rock. The holes are filled with an explosive compound of fuel oil and ammonium nitrate which blasts thousands of tons of ore in a single detonation.

Copper processing - Copper processing - Ores: Principal forms in which copper ores are found include native copper porphyry copper massive deposits and mixed ores. Native copper is simply the metal found unadulterated in nature. Occasionally copper is still found in its native form but more frequently it is mixed with other minerals some of which may have value themselves.
