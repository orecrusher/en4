 · Direct flotation is generally used to process phosphate ores that are rich in silica and dolomite minerals. The grade of P2O5 can be increased up to ~30%–34% in concentrate products at above 80% recovery [20]. A direct flotation process of phosphates has been used by Florida's phosphate mines for a long time.
