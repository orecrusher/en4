The world's deepest mine is the Mponeng gold mine in South Africa which extends to a depth of almost 2½ miles below the Earth's surface. Mining is a process of extracting minerals and metals from the Earth. These materials occur in their impure form called 'ores' which are concentrated in certain regions in the form of 'deposits'.

The large REE mining operations are loed primarily in China although four other mines are also operating in Russia the U.S. India and Australia. Additional REE mines are up-and-coming but the world does not yet rely on these mines for supply. The number of open REE deposits may also be due to the relative newness of the market for REEs.

Underground Mining is generally used for areas where the mineral seam is too far underground for open cut mining to be of use. A tunnel called a decline is created to allow workers and machinery to reach the loion of the minerals. Stope mining is used for most hard rock mining of minerals such as copper silver lead and zinc.

## What Is Subsurface Mining? 
 · Subsurface mining is the removal of deposits from the earth by drilling underneath layers of rock and dirt. These deposits are difficult to reach from the surface and require the drilling of vertical or horizontal shafts for access. The shafts are reinforced with supports before workers access the tunnels. How the subsurface minerals are mined

## Shaft sinking 
Parker Brown Mining is a physically draining profession. Shaft mining—also referred to as shaft sinking—is a type of mining process used to vertically gain access to an underground mining facility. There are many different components which make up the shaft all of which play a very important role in the mining process.

## Mini
The lifting system is used to take miners underground and back up again. It is also used to lift the mined ore to the surface. After you have designed your lifting system you will have to make a model of it. The model will have a mine winch shaft headgear and a lift cage. Figure 1: This is the tower above an old mine shaft.

## The Actual Difference Between Surface and Underground Mining
Surface mining is suitable for large low-grade ore deposits which occur below a thin layer of rock or alluvial deposits found in sand and riverbeds. Underground mining is used for small high-grade deposits covered with a thick overburden (soil and rock above the ore) or for deep and sloping deposits. General Process
