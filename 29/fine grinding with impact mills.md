 · Fine grinding to P80 sizes as low as 7 μm is becoming increasingly important as mines treat ores with smaller liberation sizes.This grinding is typically done using stirred mills such as the Isamill or Stirred Media Detritor. While fine grinding consumes less energy than primary grinding it can still account for a substantial part of a mill's energy budget.
