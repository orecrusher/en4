## 3D dynamic modelling and simulation of a golf drive
A validated dynamic model of a golf driver can be an invaluable asset in designing a well performing club. We present a model for simulating the golf drive that includes experimentally-measured inputs from actual golfers and a three-dimensional (3D) flexible shaft model based on Rayleigh beam theory.
