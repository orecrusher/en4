## 3 Basic Conveyor Belt Tracking Rules To Follow 
Conveyor belts are frequently blamed for belt tracking problems and in most cases this is unjustified. The failure cause is usually to be found in the installation itself and may be the result of poorly adjusted pulleys and rollers incorrect appliion of belt tracking measures or faulty design.
