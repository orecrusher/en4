Iron contents vary from 25 to 56 mg/kg in the different varieties of wheat and 7-23 mg/kg in rice grains. However most of this iron is removed during the milling process. Iron absorption from cereals and legumes many of which have high native iron content is generally low because of their high contents of phytate and sometimes polyphenols.

## how is iron ore transported 
There the ore is dressed and concentrated before finally being pelletised i.e. heated to form small round balls. From the processing plants the iron ore products are transported by rail to the ports. Since LKAB was founded in 1890 more than one and a half billion tonnes of iron ore have been extracted from the mines of Malmfälten.

Iron uptake by the plant is not as simple as with other essential elements. Iron is taken up by plant roots in greatest amounts in the zone of the root between cell elongation and maturation about 1 to 4 cm behind the root tip. Uptake of Fe by the plant is an active process that is energy is expended by the plant to take in Fe.
