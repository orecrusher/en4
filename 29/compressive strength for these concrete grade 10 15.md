The flexural strength of concrete is usually determined by testing a simple beam where the concentrated load is applied at each of the third points. The numbers are then expressed in a Modulus of Rupture (MR) in psi. Depending on the specific concrete mix flexural strength is ideally anywhere between 10% and 15% of the compressive strength.
