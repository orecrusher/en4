## Copper: An Ancient Metal 
Archeologists have also found evidence of mining and annealing of the abundant native copper in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the United States dating back to 5000 B.C. Native copper was likely used first as it did not require any process to purify it. It could have been hammered into shapes although it would have been very brittle.
