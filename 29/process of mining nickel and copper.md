## Enhanced methods for nickel recovery from low
Mining nickel directly is the obvious route to obtaining pure nickel however nickel can also be recovered as a byproduct of other metals. For example copper electrolysis requires a bleed to eliminate the buildup of impurities that accumulate over time as a result of the electrorefining of impure copper anode to produce pure metal hode.
