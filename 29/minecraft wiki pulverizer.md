A Pulverizer is a device used to crush different ores/ingots into pulverized dust. Different alloys (like bronze) can be created with a pulverizer. A Pulverizer gives you dust of the ore (more with the ore blocks) so when you cook the ore dust you get more ingots of the ore than if you would just smelting the ore itself. in other words you have a stack of 64 iron that turns into 128 ingots
