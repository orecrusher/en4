When sulfurous sulfuric and nitric acids in polluted air and rain react with the calcite in marble and limestone the calcite dissolves. In exposed areas of buildings and statues we see roughened surfaces removal of material and loss of carved details. Stone surface material may be lost all over or only in spots that are more reactive.
