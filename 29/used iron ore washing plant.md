 · For example sand tripoli are used to increase silica. With a lack of iron oxide to reduce the clinker sintering temperature and increase the saturation coefficient add pyrites cinder iron ore. This results in saving gas during burning. Carbonate and clay components are used to provide the necessary content of CaCO3.
