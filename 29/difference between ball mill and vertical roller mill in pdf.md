## The difference between ball mill and vertical mill in 
The difference between ball mill and vertical mill in cement grinding Over the last three decades the vertical roller mill has become the preferred ball mill for grinding of raw materials. The grinding efficiency of the vertical roller mill combined with an ability to dry grind and classify within a single unit gives the vertical roller mill a decided advantage over a ball mill system.

## Climb Milling versus Conventional Milling [ Sneaky CNC 
Climb Milling = Down Milling. Conventional Milling = Up Miling. Climb milling is when the direction of cut and rotation of the cutter combine to try to "suck" the mill up over (hence it's called "climb" milling) or away from the work. It produces the best surface finish. Here is a diagram showing climb versus conventional milling for
