## Choosing the Right Paver Base Material 
Crushed stone makes a solid paver base because it allows water drainage and is easy to work with. Like sand crushed stone comes in several varieties. The best aggregate for paver bases is a quarry processed dense grade aggregate. Quarry processing creates a combination of 3/4-inch crushed stone and stone
