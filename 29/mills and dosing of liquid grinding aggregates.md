 · The 3 Stages of Pigment Dispersion. WETTING: The formulator introduces the solid pigments into the liquid phase. In this phase air and moisture entrapped at the pigment surface are displaced to the grinding medium liquid phase. The pigment / air interfaces become pigment / liquid interface. To proceed the liquid needs to wet the pigment surface.

## Dispersing Technology 
Aggregates are particles in which primary particles are connected together by their surfaces. As a result the total surface of aggregates is smaller than the sum of the surface of the primary particles in the aggregate. Aggregates are as difficult to destroy as primary particles in the grinding process.
