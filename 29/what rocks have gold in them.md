## The Basics of Rocks and Minerals and Polar Geology — Rocks 
 · We call rocks that have been changed from one rock to another by pressure and heat metamorphic rocks. A good example of a metamorphic rock is gneiss (pronounced like "nice"). Gneiss is granite that has been put under extreme pressure and heat which caused the rock to change into something different a gneiss.
