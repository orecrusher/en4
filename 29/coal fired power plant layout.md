## How a Coal Plant Works 
How a Coal Plant Works. Coal-fired plants produce electricity by burning coal in a boiler to produce steam. The steam produced under tremendous pressure flows into a turbine which spins a generator to create electricity. The steam is then cooled condensed back into water and returned to the boiler to start the process over.
