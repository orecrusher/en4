## Energy and temperature analysis in grinding
Energy consumption and dissipation are discussed leading into a thermal model for grinding. The analysis developed over many years applies to shallow-cut conventional grinding processes and also to deep grinding processes. Energy analysis provides insights into the grinding process and suggests avenues for process improvements.

 · It has been shown for example that the replacement of a SAG mill with a HPGR in a conventional SAG-ball circuit may reduce grinding energy consumption by 15–20%. Taking into account additional savings such as media and liner wear it was found that a grinding cost saving of 25–35% was potentially achievable with the use of HPGRs in such conventional circuits.

## Ball Mill 
The High Energy Ball Mill Emax and MM 500 were developed for grinding with the highest energy input. The innovative design of both the mills and the grinding jars allows for continuous grinding down to the nano range in the shortest amount of time - with only minor warming effects. These ball mills are also suitable for mechano chemistry.
