## Rotary coolers – for optimised material processing
Similar to a direct rotary kiln our direct rotary cooler utilises a counter-current method of cooling materials via a stream of ambient or chilled air. This material processing equipment is both highly durable and versatile as it can cool a large variety of hot granular products and can handle a vast range of temperatures thanks to its stainless-steel shell and added refractory lining.
