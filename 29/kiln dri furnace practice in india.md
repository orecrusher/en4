## Direct reduced iron 
Direct reduced iron (DRI) also called sponge iron is produced from the direct reduction of iron ore (in the form of lumps pellets or fines) into iron by a reducing gas or elemental carbon produced from natural gas or coal.Many ores are suitable for direct reduction. Direct reduction refers to solid-state processes which reduce iron oxides to metallic iron at temperatures below the melting

## DRI production 
DRI production. Direct reduction of iron is the removal of oxygen from iron ore or other iron bearing materials in the solid state i.e. without melting as in the blast furnace. The reducing agents are carbon monoxide and hydrogen coming from reformed natural gas syngas or coal. Iron ore is used mostly in pellet and/or lumpy form.

## Direct Reduced Iron 
Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) also known as Sponge Iron offers an alternative steel production route to BF-BOF and Scrap-EAF routes. In DRI iron ore is reduced in its solid state – unlike BF process where a liquid metal is formed during reduction. DRI can then be transformed to steel in electric arc furnaces. DRI production is common in Middle East South America India and Mexico.
