## Pavement materials: Aggregates 
Crushing test One of the model in which pavement material can fail is by crushing under compressive stress. A test is standardized by IS:2386 part-IV and used to determine the crushing strength of aggregates. The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under gradually applied crushing load.

## Abrasion Test 
Uses Of The Abrasion Test. For an aggregate to perform satisfactorily on the pavement it must be difficult enough to resist the abrasive effect of traffic for a long period of time. Soft aggregates will be quickly crushed into powder while hard aggregates are quite resistant to crushing. The test will also determine the quality of the aggregate.
