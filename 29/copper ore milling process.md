## Copper Concentrates 
The production of concentrates implies the crushing and later milling of the ore down to a particle size allows releasing copper by flotation. The concentrates from different regions have approximately between 24% up to 36% of copper. Copper concentrates are then submitted to a final filtration and drying process to decrease the humidity to 8-9%.

Stamp Mills for Processing Gold Silver Copper Ore A stamp mill is a large mechanical device used to crush ore and extract the desired metals from the host material. It uses heavy steel stamps to crush and break apart material releasing the valuable gold from worthless rock allowing for the extraction of gold for further refining.

Processing. Our mills run the ore through ball and rod mills to reduce it to the proper size for our flotation process. Flotation separates the copper zinc and lead. After separation the various concentrates are dried to the consistency of a damp powder before being stored in our enclosed storage and shipping facility.

A stamp mill consists of a set of heavy steel (iron-shod wood in some cases) stamps loosely held vertically in a frame in which the stamps can slide up and down. They are lifted by cams on a horizontal rotating shaft.As the cam moves from under the stamp the stamp falls onto the ore below crushing the rock and the lifting process is repeated at the next pass of the cam.

 · The four major steps in the production of marketable copper are mining concentrating smelting and refining. In a few instances however leaching takes the place of concentrating smelting and refining. At present although considerable leaching and direct-smelting ores are produced the bulk of the copper ore mined is concentrated.
