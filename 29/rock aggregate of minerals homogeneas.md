## Mineral 
A rock is an aggregate of one or more minerals. (A rock may also include organic remains.) Some rocks are predominantly composed of just one mineral. For example limestone is a sedimentary rock composed almost entirely of the mineral calcite. Other rocks contain many minerals and the specific minerals in a rock can vary widely.

## Aggregates: Mineral information data and localities.
Aggregate is a broad classifiion of coarse to medium-grained rock material intended for use in construction. This can include sand gravel crushed stone and mine waste and rocks of all types can be mined or quarried for aggregate - making use of what is locally available for local construction rather than bringing higher quality rock from elsewhere at greater expense.

## ROCK DESCRIPTION natural aggregates of minerals
Rocks are natural aggregates of minerals. This definition suggests the two most important elements of a rock description: a) What minerals does it contain? and b) How are these minerals arranged or aggregated in the rock? Texture is the general name given to the arrangement of minerals in rocks.
