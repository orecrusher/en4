## What is the significance of ten percent fines value in 
Ten percent fines value is a measure of the resistance of aggregate crushing subjected to loading and it is applicable to both weak and strong aggregate. Fine aggregates are defined as those passing 2.36mm sieve. The test aims at looking for the forces required to produce 10% of fine values (i.e. weight of fines aggregates/weight []

## Aggregate Crushing Value (ACV) 
Aggregate Crushing Value (ACV) The aggregate Impact value gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to sudden shock or impact which in some aggregates differs from its resistance to a slowly applied compressive load. With aggregate of aggregate impact value higher than 30 the result may be anomalous.
