Compressive (Crushing) Strength. Amount of compressive stress at the onset of failure. The definition of failure tends to vary with material type. As with tensile tests the terms ultimate and yield can be used. However ductile materials do not break during compressive testing and therefore have no ultimate compressive strength.
