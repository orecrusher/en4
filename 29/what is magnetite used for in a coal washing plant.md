Coal washing is a process that is undertaken in a coal washery or coal preparation plant (CPP) where coal is refined or cleaned of impurities. Coal washing involves using water mechanical techniques and relies on gravity and the difference of density between coal and it's impurities which are usually more densely packed due to the fact that they are inorganic.

Magnetite is an important material component of power plants as it is used to generate electricity. Magnetite owing to its magnetic properties is widely used in compasses and other navigation devices. Magnetite also serves as an excellent abrasive which is a cleaner and has way lower toxicity than abrasives that have a silica base.

 · It is also used in coal mining operations as a slurry with water to remove the heavier impurities by allowing the less dense coal to float to the surface. The magnetite can be reused in this process 90 percent of the time. Magnetite is also used as a source of iron to manufacture iron-based chemicals and fertilizers.
