## Recovery of Iron Values From Tailing Dumps Adopting 
The iron ore deposits in India are rich in iron content but usually contains high alumina and silica. The current industrial practice results three products namely lump fines and slimes. The lump and fines with or without beneficiation are directly fed to the blast furnace and sintering plant respectively while the super fines or slimes are presently discarded as tailings.
