## Crushing Vs Grinding 
Crushing is usually a dry process while milling is performed with water. The advantage of wet milling is the lower energy input compared to dry milling. Additionally some chemical reagents can be used to minimize the energy consumption of grinding because grinding energy is minimum at pH of the point of zero electrical charges of the material surface which is known as Rebinder effect.
