## Natural stone strength (compression bending and abrasion 
 · A stone floor has to withstand loads of people and heavy objects. So compressive strength is the highest load per unit area borne by the stone without giving in. A higher compressive strength between1800 psi (12.45 MPa) and 19000 psi (131 MPa) means the stone can endure an upper crushing load. Dry or wet conditions as per load determine the
