Investigations were carried out to establish its amenability for physical beneficiation on a low grade siliceous iron ore sample by magnetic separation. Mineralogical studies with the help of microscope as well as XRD SEM-EDS revealed that the sample consists of magnetite hematite and goethite as major opaque oxide minerals where as quartz and kaolinite form the gangue minerals in the sample.

The iron ore industry faces continuous pressure to reduce the process costs (e.g. grinding below 50 µm to liberate the iron oxides from the gangue in low-grade ores. An ideal blast furnace feed should have about 65% of Fe and an Al2O3/SiO2 ratio of 1 in order to achieve optimized productivity and sufficient slag flow ability respectively.
