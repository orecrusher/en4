## Crushed Concrete Aggregate
 · Recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) refers to crushed concrete and other materials suitable for use as fill and compactible fill. Initiatives to use CCA in concrete mixes have proceeded slowly and cautiously for many reasons. A central concern is whether CCA can have the same quality as materials—a pile of demolished concrete could have

## Engineering Seminars: DEMOLITION OF CONCRETE STRUCTURES
 · Secondary concrete crushers usually have some type of pulverizing jaws and are used on jobs where primary demolition is accomplished by hammers crushers blasting ball and crane or sawing. In this instance the primary demolition work creates large quantities of concrete rubble which the secondary crusher further reduces separating concrete from reinforcement.

 · If strength of concrete is lesser than expected then the structure shall be re-validated with a structural expert for acceptance or rejection. If acceptable from the structural point of view then a reduction in the price shall be made to compensate for the reduced strength. Engineer in charge shall make the assessment for a reduction in price.

As per the British standards concrete is capable of carrying a strain up to 0.0035 and steel starts yielding at a strain of 0.002 and it can increase greater than the concrete. When the axial stress exceeds a certain amount resulting in concrete strain grater than 0.0035 concrete will fail suddenly. It will be a sudden crushing of concrete.
