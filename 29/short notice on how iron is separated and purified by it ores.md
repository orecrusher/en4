## Early History of Electricity and Magnetism
 · Steel is an alloy of iron with 0.5-1% of dissolved carbon.Since iron is extracted from its ores by heating it with carbon (much of which is burned away while heating the mix) the molten iron first emerging solidifies to cast iron with about 4% of carbon. Cast iron is strong but too hard to work and somewhat brittle as its large hard crystals may break apart.
