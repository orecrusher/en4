A. Portland cement is the product obtained by pulverizing clinker consisting of hydraulic calcium silies to which some calcium sulfate has usually been provided as an interground addition. When first made and used in the early 19th century in England it was termed portland cement because its hydration product resembled a building stone from the Isle of Portland off the British coast.

How Concrete is Made. In its simplest form concrete is a mixture of paste and aggregates or rocks. The paste composed of portland cement and water coats the surface of the fine (small) and coarse (larger) aggregates. Through a chemical reaction called hydration the paste hardens and gains strength to form the rock-like mass known as concrete.
