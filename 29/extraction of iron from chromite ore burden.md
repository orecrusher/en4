## Chromite 
Chromite is a crystalline mineral composed primarily of iron(II) oxide and chromium(III) oxide compounds. It can be represented by the chemical formula of FeCr 2 O 4.It is an oxide mineral belonging to the spinel group.The element magnesium can substitute for iron in variable amounts as it forms a solid solution with magnesiochromite (MgCr 2 O 4). A substitution of the element aluminium can

## Comparative study of alkali roasting and leaching of 
 · At 1000 °C chromite ore reacted to a significant extent with alkali and most chromium was extracted as sodium or potassium chromate by water leaching. The wt.% of Cr 2 O 3 decreased from 48.8% in the as-received chromite sample to 3.65% and 3.73% in the water leached residues after roasting with sodium and potassium hydroxides respectively.

The material from these crushers passes by a chute lined with screens having holes ¾ inches in diameter to a second set of four crushers set so as to close to one inch.
