## An analysis of medium losses in coal washing plants 
Coal washeries that employ dense-medium cyclones often attempt optimization of the processes by varying the vortex or the spigot diameter and the feed relative density. While these changes help in closer control of the separation process they also result in medium losses due to changes in the medium split ratio (ratio of the medium flow rate in overflow to underflow).

## DENSE MEDIUM CYCLONE
medium cyclones gained importance for treating intermediate size coal because of its ability to separate near density material effectively. So most of the Indian coal washeries incorporated dense medium cyclones in intermediate size coal washing circuits. Presently 55-60% of the washed coal is produced by dense medium cyclones.
