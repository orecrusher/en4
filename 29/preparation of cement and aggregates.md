## WHAT ARE THE PROPERTIES OF AGGREGATES FOR CONCRETE 
 · Aggregates are used in concrete to provide economy in the cost of concrete. Aggregates act as filler only. These do not react with cement and water. But there are properties or characteristics of aggregate which influence the properties of resulting concrete mix. These are as follow. Composition. Size Shape.

## Understanding the Role of Aggregates in Concrete 
Cement is necessary but the strength can still be retained when using well-graded aggregates that cost significantly less. Aggregates make up 60-80% of the volume of concrete and 70-85% of the mass of concrete. Aggregate is also very important for strength thermal and elastic properties of concrete dimensional stability and volume stability.

## How to Calculate Cement Sand and Coarse Aggregate 
Concrete Ingredients Calculation. For Cement Sand and Coarse Aggregate. This is a Volumetric Calculation. Assuming we need 2 m 3 of concrete for M20 Concrete Mix (Mix Ratio M20 = 1 : 1.5 : 3) Total Part of the Concrete = 1+1.5+3 = 5.5 Parts. Therefore Cement Quantity = (Cement Part / Concrete Parts )  Concrete Volume

 · Capping a concrete cylinder means placing a smooth uniform cap/layer at the end of a concrete cylinder to provide for a uniform load distribution when testing. Since the concrete sample will contain voids and aggregate particles at the upper surface that is left open it is necessary to prepare a smooth uniform surface for the testing machine to press against.
