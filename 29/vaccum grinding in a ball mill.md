## Kinetics of fine wet grinding in a laboratory ball mill 
 · Grinding was carried out in the laboratory ball mill described in Table 1 at a low ball load of 20% of the mill volume filled with the ball bed and a low powder load corresponding to a formal interstitial filling of void spaces of the ball bed of U=0.5. These conditions were chosen since it is known that they give first order grinding kinetics for normal grinding both dry and wet.

Ball mills are characterized by their smaller (comparatively) diameter and longer length and often have a length 1.5 to 2.5 times the diameter. The feed is at one end of the cylinder and the discharge is at the other. Small versions of ball mills can be found in laboratories where they are used for grinding sample material for quality assurance.

## Ball Milling 
Ball milling is a size reduction technique that uses media in a rotating cylindrical chamber to mill materials to a fine powder. As the chamber rotates the media is lifted up on the rising side and then cascades down from near the top of the chamber. With this motion the particles in between the media and chamber walls are reduced in size by

 · There are basically two methods of producing nano-scale particles: the "Bottom-Up" technique involves synthesizing the particles from atoms and molecules. With the "Top-Down" method the particles are reduced to nanometer size by grinding. Suitable tools for this method are planetary ball mills such as Retsch's new PM-series grinders which provide the necessary energy input.
