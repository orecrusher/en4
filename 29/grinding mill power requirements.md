Scale Up in Sizing for Grinding Mills. Scale-up criterion is the net specific power consumption i.e. the power consumed by the mill rotor itself minus all mechanical and electrical losses divided by the feed rate of solids. For the full scale mill specific power is multiplied by the feed rate to get the net mill power.

## CALCULATION OF THE POWER DRAW OF DRY 
For all model based methods a reliable method to calculate mill power draw for a given mill is required for the calculation of power draw. Morrell (1996) proposed a mathematical model for autogenous semi-autogenous and ball mills which is based on the motion of grinding charge inside the mill. He also verified his approach with

## Best energy consumption 
 · Grinding energy was approximately 50 per cent of the ball mill and the drying capabilities allowed direct processing of materials of up to 20 per cent moisture content. The main energy issue was the high power consumption of mill fans with pressure drops of 100mbar not uncommon with high nozzle ring velocities (>70m/s) and internal mill circulating loads of >1000 per cent.
