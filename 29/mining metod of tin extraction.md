Streaming remained the method of extracting tin until the 15th century first mainly from Bodmin Moor. But then its centre of gravity moved westwards and shallow mines began to appear. The early control of the industry by merchants and financiers gave way after the Black Death of the mid-1300s to a more decentralised industry dominated by small farmer-tinners who maintained the supply of tin.

## Extracting salt from mines
Most salt mines operate underground but in salt deserts the rock salt is also mined at the surface. Two main methods of extracting rock salt are used in underground mining: Cut and blast mining consists in cutting slots at the base of the rock face. A series of carefully sited holes are drilled and then charged with explosives to blast the rock.
