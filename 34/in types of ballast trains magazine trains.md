 · Ballasted and non-ballasted track. 09/12/2015 in HS2. A high proportion of existing high speed tracks have been constructed using ballast. Several such systems have now been in operation for many years including ballasted high-speed tracks in Belgium (SNCB) France (SNCF) Germany (DB) China (MOR) and parts of the network in Japan (CJR/EJR/WJR).

## Track ballast 
Track ballast forms the trackbed upon which railroad ties (sleepers) are laid. It is packed between below and around the ties. It is used to bear the load from the railroad ties to facilitate drainage of water and also to keep down vegetation that might interfere with the track structure. Ballast also holds the track in place as the trains roll over it.

In maglev trains the secondary is attached to the bottom of the train cars and the primary is in the guideway. So a magnetic field is sent down the guideway and it pulls the train along after it. In a way then the entire length of a maglev track can be considered to be part of the train's motor.

## Effect of Sleeper Interventions on Railway Track 
The sleeper/ballast interface is an essential stage in the transfer of train loads from a railway track structure into the ground. Generally only a small number of ballast grains support the sleeper base. The resulting localized contact stresses can be very high especially for modern concrete sleepers on hard igneous ballast.
