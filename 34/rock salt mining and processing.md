## Mineral Extraction 
Mineral extraction (mining) and petroleum and gas production are major resource extraction activities that provide the raw materials to support our economic infrastructure. An enormous amount of pollution is generated from the extraction and use of natural resources. The Environmental Protection Agency's Toxic Releases Inventory report lists mining as the single largest source of toxic waste

## Salt Cavern 
Salt caverns are artificial cavities in underground salt formations which are created by the controlled dissolution of rock salt by injection of water during the solution mining process. Geometrical volumes of a few 100 000 m 3 and up to 1 000 000 m 3 and more in individual cases can be achieved depending on technical specifiions and geological conditions.

## What is Industrial Salt Supply and How Much Does It Cost?
Rock salt is found underground and very little processing is done to the salt after it is removed. That's why rock salt contains natural impurities like rock and shale which aren't soluble. That's not an issue when it's spread on the highway but it can be an issue for other manufacturing processes in which these insoluble materials can damage manufacturing equipment.

Rock salt. Obtaining rock salt by open-cast mining. Salar Grande Chile. Rock salt is the name for dry salt that is extracted from salt-bearing (saliniferous) rock layers with the help of mining methods. Most salt mines operate underground but in salt deserts the rock salt is also mined on the surface (open-cast mining).

Since the mine opened the extraction of the salt has been via a square-patterned room and pillar method of mining. This leaves pillars of rock salt behind to support the roof structure. Work is carried out by staff of the Mining Department at Newcastle University to monitor the structure of the mine as it is the nature of rock salt to move over time and this must be constantly monitored.

MINING AND PROCESSING: Iron ore mining can be broadly divided into two egories namely 1) manual mining which is employed in small mines and 2) mechanized mining is suitable for large iron ore mines. Manual mining method is normally limited to float ores and small mines. Mining of reef ore is also being done manually on a small scale.

Most salt mines operate underground but in salt deserts the rock salt is also mined at the surface. Two main methods of extracting rock salt are used in underground mining: Cut and blast mining consists in cutting slots at the base of the rock face. A series of carefully sited holes are drilled and then charged with explosives to blast the rock.
