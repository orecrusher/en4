## Overview of our mills · Christian Pfeiffer
Ball mills are the classic grinding plants: Around the world they are the most common installations. Ball mills convince thanks to their simple principle and low maintenance needs: They are robust durable and extremely reliable in operation. By using ball mills in closed circuit with a separator their efficiency can be increased even further.

## Rod mills how they function 
Rod mills are very similar to ball mills except they use long rods for grinding media. The rods grind the ore by tumbling within the the mill similar to the grinding balls in a ball mill. To prevent the conditions leading to rod charge tangling the length to diameter ratio is maintained at 1.4 to 1.6.

## Circular Interpolation: Machining Circular Tool Paths 
 · All rotating end mills have their own angular velocity at the outside diameter. But when the tool path is circular there is an additional component that is introduced resulting in a compound angular velocity. Basically this means the velocity of the outside diameter is travelling at a substantially different velocity than originally expected.
