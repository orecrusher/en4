 · After the discovery of gold in 1886 South Africa moved from an agricultural economy to an industrial economy because of the growth of the mining industry. Accompanying this growth was the influence mining companies had on governments in the region to establish the migrant labour system which guaranteed a steady stream of cheap labour to the mines.

Mining operations are generating increased waste because South Africa's gold is running out and the remaining resource can only be found several miles below ground.
