Breakage in the hammer mill occurs primarily due to the impact of the hammers and large particles may often leak through the mill without sufficient breakage. Breakage in the comil is more gradual as the impeller sweeps a wide area generally ensuring sufficient breakage of particles before they exit the milling chamber.
