## Gold extraction 
Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores. This may require a combination of comminution mineral processing hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore. Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold panning and sluicing resulting in direct recovery of small gold

## Gold Recovery And How To Choose 
Gold deposits can be grouped into two primary classes: placer deposits where the gold is exposed from weathering and erosion and hard rock where the gold is still trapped within the host rock. Gold recovery methods for these two types of deposits vary greatly from simple panning to a complex network of grinding chemical leaching gravity concentration and more.

 · Cyanide extraction of gold may be used in areas where fine gold-bearing rocks are found. Sodium cyanide solution is mixed with finely ground rock that has been proven to contain gold or silver and is then separated as a gold cyanide or silver cyanide solution from ground rock. To precipitate residual zinc and silver and gold metals zinc is added.

## 25.2 Extracting ores 
This section looks at methods to get very large rocks crushed and ground until it is as fine as powder. The first concept that needs to come across here is that minerals are inside rocks and by crushing rocks the minerals are exposed at the surface of the rock fragment. Only then can chemicals be used to extract the mineral.

## Introduction to Mineral Processing or Beneficiation
 · Most rock deposits contain metals or minerals but when the concentration of valuable minerals or metals is too low to justify mining it is considered a waste or gangue material. Within an ore body valuable minerals are surrounded by gangue and it is the primary function of mineral processing to liberate and concentrate those valuable minerals.
