## Mining Tools of the 1850's 
Mining Tools of the 1850's. Miners used many different methods to extract gold from the ground. Some methods used basic tools while others required the use of quite complex machines. Below are pictures and descriptions of some different mining tools. Gold Panning. Gold panning was probably the simplest form of gold mining in the 1850's and today.

## Causes Effects and Solutions for Mining 
For mining purposes big machines that emit large amounts of harmful gases are frequently used. These gases also include greenhouse gases like CO2 and methane which contribute to global warming. Moreover since an increase in mining activities also implies an increase in deforestation this also contributes to global warming since trees are natural storage spaces for greenhouse gases like CO2.

## Extracting Gold 
To isolate pure gold mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.

## How Is Quartz Extracted? 
 · Quartz is extracted from open pit mines. Miners only use explosives on rare occasions when they need to expose a deep seam of quartz. The reason for this is that although quartz is known for its hardness it damages easily if it is suddenly exposed to a change in temperature such as that caused by a blast.

There are four main mining methods: underground open surface (pit) placer and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits. Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits. Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels beach sands or other environments.
