 · Crushed vs Round aggregate in concrete. ACI 318-05 and -08 does not appear to reward the designer for specifying crushed aggregate over rounded (usually "river rock") in structural concrete. Chapter 4 refers to ASTM C33 and leaves it at that. Certainly crushed rock has better interlock and must have better shear friction for roughened surfaces.
