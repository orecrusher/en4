The mine haul trucks dump ore to two primary crushers (60/113 MK-II gyratory crusher). Crushed ore is transferred via an overland conveyor to a 230000 t capacity (40000 t live capacity) stockpile adjacent to the processing plant. Dozers operating on the coarse ore stockpile can increase the total storage capacity up to 400000 t.
