## Gold Extraction Recovery Processes
 · The processing of gold ores has traditionally made use of conventional crushing and grinding circuits. In each case where gold is formed either as coarse native particles or in coarse grained sulphides it is recovered by gravimetry concentration in the in the comminution circuit in addition to recovery of finer values by leaching.

 · Nature of Gold: The surface of a gold particle will typically be dissolved at a rate of around 0.2-0.5 µm of surface depth per hour in a cyanide leach. For large gold particles and nuggets this is too slow to be fully dissolved in a typical processing plant. Much simpler and less expensive gravity methods are available to recover this gold.
