 · During dry processing hard massive ore results in generation of coarser fraction known as sized ore having size from 10 to 40 mm and used in blast furnace while soft goethite-rich mineral tends to generate fine fraction known as fine ore having size below 8–10 mm. Dry processing of iron ore is popular for treating hard massive hematitic ores; however fines generated during processing

DRI production. Direct reduction of iron is the removal of oxygen from iron ore or other iron bearing materials in the solid state i.e. without melting as in the blast furnace. The reducing agents are carbon monoxide and hydrogen coming from reformed natural gas syngas or coal. Iron ore is used mostly in pellet and/or lumpy form.
