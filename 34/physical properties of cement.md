## Cement 
A cement is a binder a substance used for construction that sets hardens and adheres to other materials to bind them together. Cement is seldom used on its own but rather to bind sand and gravel together.Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry or with sand and gravel produces concrete.Concrete is the most widely used material in existence and is behind only water

## Properties of Cement
 · The soundness of cement is affected by the presence of excess lime and magnesia. The excess lime hydrates very slowly to form slaked lime and will affect the physical properties of cement. The hydration difference between free lime (CaO) and slaked lime can change the volume of concrete on hardening and these changes make cement unsound.
