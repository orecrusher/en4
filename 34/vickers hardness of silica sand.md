## The Hard Truth About Particle Contamination
 · In contrast quartz has a Vickers hardness of approximately 1200 (7 on the Mohs scale) which is roughly 1.5 times harder than chrome steel. Quartz was chosen for comparison because it is one of the most abundant minerals in soil (primarily sand). Silica-dioxide crystals are commonly referred to as quartz and can be found in most soils.

## Vickers hardness test 
The Vickers hardness test was developed in 1921 by Robert L. Smith and George E. Sandland at Vickers Ltd as an alternative to the Brinell method to measure the hardness of materials. The Vickers test is often easier to use than other hardness tests since the required calculations are independent of the size of the indenter and the indenter can be used for all materials irrespective of hardness.
