## Particle
The particle-size distribution (PSD) of a powder or granular material or particles dispersed in fluid is a list of values or a mathematical function that defines the relative amount typically by mass of particles present according to size. Significant energy is usually required to disintegrate soil etc. particles into the PSD that is then called a grain size distribution.
