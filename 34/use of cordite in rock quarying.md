Rock quarries usually operate for at least 30 years and are developed in distinct benches or steps. A controlled explosion is normally used to release the rock from the working face. It is then transported by truck or conveyor to a crusher where it goes through a series of crushing and screening stages to produce a range of final sizes to suit customers' needs.

## Quarrying 
Quarrying involves the fracture of large fragments from rock beds largely due to the process of discontinuous rock-mass failure. Preglacial weathering can also weaken rocks and assists the quarrying process. Additionally freeze-thaw processes may be active beneath glacier margins where heat can be evacuated from the bed.
