## What are Large Scale Production? What are its motives?
 · Large-scale production is a mass production or standardised production. Goods of uniform quality are turned out irrespec­tive of the requirements of individual customers. Individual tastes are not therefore satisfied. This results in a loss of customers.

## Economies of Scale and International Trade
Economies of scale in production means that production at a larger scale (more output) can be achieved at a lower cost (i.e. with economies or savings). A simple way to formalize this is to assume that the unit labor requirement in the production of a good is a function of the level of output produced.
