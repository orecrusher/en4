This primer discusses two approaches for estimating the biomass density of woody formations based on existing forest inventory data. The first approach is based on the use of existing measured volume estimates (VOB per ha) converted to biomass density (t/ha) using a variety of "tools" (Brown et al. 1989 Brown and Iverson 1992 Brown and Lugo 1992 Gillespie et al. 1992).

## How to lower the chance of rotary drum dryer fires 
 · Using a rotary dryer for biomass material has always been a point of contention because the dryer's design is not modified substantially for the biomass industry and fire is a common incident. This problem is happening more frequently as pellet manufacturers intend to blend new wood species in their conventional SPF (spruce pine douglas fir) feedstock.
