JXSC' gold mining solutions design allows you to start recovering minerals with a base wash plant (scrubber / concentrator) unit. Various crushing milling equipment can be ordered to make your solution more comprehensive. This can be implemented at a later stage once you have begun to see an initial return on investment. This way JXSC provides miners with a low capital starting point.

## What Were Some of the Tools That Were Used in the Gold Mines?
 · 5 Pans. Panning for gold was also known as "placer mining." Early miners sat by riverbeds scooping wet soil into shallow metal pans. They swirled the pans washing away the dirt to hopefully discover particles of gold. Though more complex equipment was eventually invented pans were still a useful tool to distinguish gold from dirt.

## Hydraulic mining 
Hydraulic mining is a form of mining that uses high-pressure jets of water to dislodge rock material or move sediment. In the placer mining of gold or tin the resulting water-sediment slurry is directed through sluice boxes to remove the gold. It is also used in mining kaolin and coal.. Hydraulic mining developed from ancient Roman techniques that used water to excavate soft underground deposits.
