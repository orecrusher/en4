## How to resolve the most common hydrocyclone problems
 · The grinding mill might be the issue. Of course the hydrocyclone isn't the only place to look when you are reviewing the classifiion of your grinding mill circuit.. Often when we're investigating a mill circuit there are cases where the amount of new feed to the plant has exceeded the ability of the mill to grind the ore fine enough to allow the cyclones to generate the desired

## Autogenous and Semi
Rely on our proven track record of SAG and AG Mill superiority. Since the early 1980s we have been designing and manufacturing Semi-Autogenous (SAG) and Autogenous (AG) Grinding Mills under the Fuller-Traylor brand. Semi-autogenous grinding uses a minimal ball charge in the range of 6-15% while autogenous grinding uses ore only.
