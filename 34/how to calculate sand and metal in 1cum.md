 · When it is made with a cement/sand ratio of 1/4 there will be 1 part of cement 4 parts of sand so 5 parts in total. Therefore the amount of sand needed is 4/5 x 2 m3 = 1.6 m3. The rest (2.0-1.6) = 0.4 m3 is cement. You will also need water of course but its quantity doesn't affect this calculation.
