## Gold Extraction Recovery Processes
 · The processing of gold ores has traditionally made use of conventional crushing and grinding circuits. In each case where gold is formed either as coarse native particles or in coarse grained sulphides it is recovered by gravimetry concentration in the in the comminution circuit in addition to recovery of finer values by leaching.

Cyanidation leaching is the primary means of recovery of fine gold and silver. In this process solutions of sodium or potassium cyanide are brought into contact with an ore which may or may not have required extensive preparation prior to leaching. Gold and silver are dissolved by cyanide in solutions of high pH in the presence of oxygen.

## The environmental impact of gold production
However gold is produced in much smaller quantities so the total environmental footprint for global gold production is smaller than some other commonly used metals including steel copper and aluminium. The stages that contributed the most to gold's environmental impact were mining and comminution (crushing and grinding of the ore).

 · The gold cyanide complex is then extracted from the pulp or slurry by adsorption onto activated carbon. CIL stands for carbon-in-leach. This is a gold extraction process called cyanidation where carbon is added to the leach tanks (or reaction vessel) so that leaching and adsorption take place in the same tanks.

free circulation of the leaching agent. The leaching period is 2 – 4 days and gold recovery lies in the order of 70 – 80%. The cheapest but slowest technique is heap leaching. It is a process usually applied to low grade gold ore. Basically the ore is piled to a given height on an inclined impermeable surface a so called leach pad.
