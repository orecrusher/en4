6 Uses of Molybdenum. Molybdenum is a refractory metal with a melting point of is 2620℃. It has a small expansion coefficient high conductivity and good thermal conductivity. At room temperature molybdenum does not react with hydrochloric acid hydrofluoric acid and alkali solution only dissolve in nitric acid aqua regia or concentrated sulfuric acid.

## Copper
Further because optimum moly flotation pH is at 7-8 while optimum copper selectivity is typically in the 9-11 pH range use of a moly collector in bulk flotation can improve floatability. Some mines find that the moly collectors can have a negative impact on copper flotation so testing and evaluation must be conducted to find the optimum moly collector hydrocarbon and frother products.
