## The Lime Industry's Problem of Airborne Dust
quarrying methods are used with var-ious types of equipment. In obtaining broken stone the usual operations in-volved are: (1) drilling holes for explo-sives; (2) blasting the limestone loose; (3) loading it into trucks or cars; and (4) conveying it to the crusher. Di-mension stone is quarried by sawing and cutting and is not used for lime

## Mineral Appraisals: What is the Value of a Quarry or Mine?
quarries and mines are pre-existing uses (in operation prior to enacting zoning ordinances) court-ordered or annexed into a city. Annexation is a tool used by municipalities to gain some control over grandfathered or court-ordered quarries. The quarry operator usually pays rent or a per-ton royalty to the municipality.
