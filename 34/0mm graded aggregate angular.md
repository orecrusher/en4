Figure 2: More angular (left) vs. more rounded (right) fine aggregate. Angular materials are desirable in paving mixtures because they tend to lock together and resist deformation after initial compaction whereas rounded materials may not produce sufficient inter-particle friction to prevent rutting.

## What Aggregate Packing is Optimal?
Aggregate packing is one of several factors to consider in selecting aggregates. Aggregate gradings finer than maximum packing density are often preferred. The packing density along with shape is useful in determining amount of paste required. Consider the combined solid particle size distribution.
