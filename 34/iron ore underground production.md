Mining of Iron Ores – IspatGuru · On a world scale the quantities produced are low. Since the iron ore is extracted in underground mines (Fig. 2) mining costs are hardly competitive compared to the open pit mines of for example Australia or Brazil. As a consequence the low iron ore prices have been very problematic for mining companies.
