## Four Production Processes In The Mineral Beneficiation 
 · To extract the minerals carrying the valuable metal from the ore a combination of separation operations typically known as mineral processing or ore beneficiation is required. The objective of the mineral processing plant is to increase in an economically viable manner the concentration of valuable minerals so that the subsequent metal extraction process becomes profitable.

India possesses vast reserves of iron ore. All the ex-isting iron and steel plants in the country utilize hemati-tic ores though a few deposits of magnetite are also being considered for utilization. Until very recently only hand-mining was employed to prepare iron ore of uniform size and composition for smooth blast-furnace operation.

Iron ore is smelted after going through beneficiation. The iron ore industry classifies the material by the concentration of the metal that is present after iron ore beneficiation has been completed. High-grade iron ore must have a concentration of 65% iron or higher and medium grade of 62% to 65%.
