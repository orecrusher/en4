Iron is essential for plant growth and is generally considered to be a micronutrient (Thompson and Troeh 1973). Iron is considered the key metal in energy transformations needed for syntheses and other life processes of the cells. Consequently plants regulate iron uptake. Ferrous iron is more soluble and bioavailable to plants than ferric iron.
