 · For example through crushing the mineral ore to below a certain size and finishing by grinding it into powder the ultimate fineness depends on the fineness of dissemination of the desired mineral. Grinding can be done wet or dry depending on the process in use but for dry grinding the materials first may need to be dried in cylindrical rotary dryers.

 · Finally clays for the preparation of ceramic slips would reasonably be expected to be ground wet since the initial condition of the clay is wet and it is required in a wet form for subsequent processing. Clearly in such a case dry grinding which would involve drying would be uneconomic and would only be adopted in very special circumstances.
