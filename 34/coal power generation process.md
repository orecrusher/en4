## How a Coal Plant Works 
How a Coal Plant Works. Coal-fired plants produce electricity by burning coal in a boiler to produce steam. The steam produced under tremendous pressure flows into a turbine which spins a generator to create electricity. The steam is then cooled condensed back into water and returned to the boiler to start the process over.

## Coal Generator 
The Coal Generator is a power generator building that generates power by burning Coal Compacted Coal or Petroleum Coke and Water. It is the first fully automate-able power source the pioneer has access to and also the first power source to use a mined resource. One Coal Generator produces 75 MW at 100% clock speed. 1 Fuel consumption 2 Generators per Coal node 3 Generators fueled by

Brief Description of Process Coal is burnt in a boiler in a coal power plant to generate heat that is used to boil the water present to produce steam. The steam rotates the motor of the turbines that in turn rotates the generation rotor to produce electricity. This process requires the preparation of coal ensuring adequate air supply for

## How Coal Works 
 · How coal is formed. Coal is formed when dead plant matter submerged in swamp environments is subjected to the geological forces of heat and pressure over hundreds of millions of years. Over time the plant matter transforms from moist low-carbon peat to coal an energy- and carbon-dense black or brownish-black sedimentary rock.

## Coal Energy 
Coal is used as a fuel to heat liquid water into high pressure steam. This steam is then used to turn the turbine of a steam turbine generator which will create electricity from the power of steam which was fueled by coal energy. The efficiency of the coal power plant electric generation process has improved in efficiency over the years
