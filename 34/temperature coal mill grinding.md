Temperature management is one of the main challenges of industrial grinding. During operation the ambient temperature inside conventional mills can rise to over 390°F (200°C). At that temperature many materials deform or melt before they can even be pulverized. Other materials may not degrade but remain too flexible to properly grind.

 · A higher Hardgrove index indies the coal is easier to grind. 50 HGI normally is taken for calculating the base capacity of the mill. When coal with HGI higher than 50 is fed to the pulverizer the output will be higher than base capacity and below 50 HGI the output will be lower. The total moisture in coal has a high effect on mill output.
