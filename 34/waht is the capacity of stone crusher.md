## Stones Tests:weatheringdurabilitywater absorption 
 · Stones tests for durability of natural building stones. At least three test pieces each 50 mm cubes or 50 mm dia cylinders of 50 mm height shall he dried for 24 hours and weighed (W 1 ). The test pieces are then suspended -in a saturated solution of sodium sulphate decahydrate for 18 hours at room temperature 20 to 30°C.

## Fact Sheet: Permeable Paving – M
 · For all permeable paving base course is a reservoir layer of 1"-2" crushed stone; depth to be determined by storage required and frost penetration. Permeable paving require a single-size grading of base material in order to provide voids for rainwater storage; choice of materials is a compromise between stiffness permeability and storage capacity.

## TECHNICAL NOTES 5 CRUSHERS 
Figure 5.1 Schematic diagram of a crusher showingg the open- and closed-side settings. 5.1 Jaw and Gyratory Crushers. Jaw and gyratory crushers are used mostly for primary crushing. They are characterized by wide gape and narrow discharge and are designed to handle large quantities of material. The capacity of the crusher is determined by its size.

## Estimate Jaw Crusher Capacity
 · The capacities are based on the crusher receiving full continuous feed of clean dry friable stone weighing 100 lb/cu ft. These capacity tables show several significant differences between the two common types of primary crushers. A jaw crusher has a wider range of settings—generally a maximum of two to three times the smallest setting.

## Sub
The sub-base layer is often the main load-bearing layer of a pavement. It is designed to evenly spread the load of the paving and any traffic thereon to the sub-grade below. A well-constructed sub-base will aid drainage and prevent settlement and channelisation - the phenomenon common on cheap installations of block paving where two 'ruts' develop in the paving.

## Bearing Capacity of 95% compacted fill 
 · For a well graded crushed sand and gravel (road base) I've seen as much as 400 kPa used (assuming that there is no underlying softer material within the zone of influence). We've compacted residual clayey silt to silty clay at 95% standard Proctor and obtained an effective friction angle of 32deg. Could use that to estimate bearing capacity.

From Eqs. (1) (2) and (4) the volumetric capacity of a jaw crusher can be written as: Vh = 60N x w(S+T)/2 DT/[G-(S+T)] (5) at low speeds and Vh = 60N x w(S+T)/2 450 g/N2 (6) = 2.645 x 105 (S+T/2)/N

## Gravel 
Gravel is a major basic raw material in construction. Sand is not usually distinguished from gravel in official statistics but crushed stone is treated as a separate egory. In 2020 sand and gravel together made up 23% of all industrial mineral production in the U.S. with a total value of about $12.6 billion.

## Single Roll Crushers 
The Single Roll Crusher with its 6:1 ratio of reduction is ideal for reducing large feed lumps to a medium product size while producing a considerably lower percentage of fines. The minimum product sizing of a Single Roll Crusher is generally limited to 2-3". The crushing is carried out between the full width of the extra-long curved crushing plate and the low-speed crushing roll. The
