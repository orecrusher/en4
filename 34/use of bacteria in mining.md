## microbes used inmining 
Microbes are playing increasingly important roles in commercial mining operations where they are being used in the "bioleaching" of copper uranium and gold ores. Direct leaching is when microbial metabolism changes the redox state of the metal being harvested rendering it more soluble.

## Demining 
Demining or mine clearance is the process of removing land mines from an area. In military operations the object is to rapidly clear a path through a minefield and this is often done with devices such as mine plows and blast waves. By contrast the goal of humanitarian demining is to remove all of the landmines to a given depth and make the land safe for human use.

## Heavy Metal Mining Using Microbes 
Abstract The use of acidiphilic chemolithotrophic iron- and sulfur-oxidizing microbes in processes to recover metals from certain types of copper uranium and gold-bearing minerals or mineral concentrates is now well established. During these processes insoluble metal sulfides are oxidized to soluble metal sulfates. Mineral decomposition is believed to be mostly due to chemical attack by
