The first blast furnaces appeared in the 14th century and produced one ton per day. Even though equipment is improved and higher production rates can be achieved the processes inside the blast furnace remain the same. The blast furnace uses coke iron ore and limestone to produce pig iron. Coal is a key part of the coke-making process.
