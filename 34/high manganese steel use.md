Abstract. Steel that possesses proof stress not less than 1200 MPa fracture toughness not less than 200 MPa (sqrt m ) at 4 K and good rust resistance is required as the structural material for superconducting magnets (SCM). Some of the authors previously reported that 0.05C-0.3Si-25Mn-15Cr-1Cu-1Ni-0.2N steel satisfied nearly all the requirements and was a promising structural material for SCM.
