## OEE Factors – Understand Availability Performance 
Availability. Availability takes into account Availability Loss which includes any events that stop planned production for an appreciable length of time (usually several minutes; long enough for an operator to log a reason).. Examples of things that create Availability Loss include Unplanned Stops (such as equipment failures and material shortages) and Planned Stops (such as changeover time).

## Calculate TEEP – Measure Utilization and Capacity 
What is TEEP? TEEP (Total Effective Equipment Performance) is a performance metric that provides insights as to the true capacity of your manufacturing operation. It takes account both Equipment Losses (as measured by OEE) and Schedule Losses (as measured by Utilization).. TEEP is calculated by multiplying four factors: Availability Performance Quality and Utilization.
