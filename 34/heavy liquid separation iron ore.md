## Heavy Liquid Separation Iron Ore 
Heavy Liquid Separation Iron Ore. Iron ore occurs naturally in a variety of forms from sand like iron fines to solid rock mass Crude ore or ore mined in the natural state seldom occurs in a pure state and requires some form heavy media separation or flotation Magnetic separation is used to separate iron ores from less magnetic material and can be classified as.

## Dense
 · Heavy liquids of suitable density are used so that those minerals lighter than the liquid float while those denser than it sink (Figure 11.1). Since most of the liquids used in the laboratory are expensive or toxic the dense medium used in industrial separations is a thick suspension or pulp of some heavy solid in water which behaves as a heavy liquid.
