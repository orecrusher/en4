## How Are Diamonds Mined And Extracted From the Ground
There's another form of alluvial mining called artisanal mining. In essence it is basically the same method employed by gold diggers which involves the screening and straining of mud. In the case of artisanal mining the extraction process usually takes a longer time as it involves low tech equipment and manual labor.

## Mineral Processing 
Mineral processing mineral beneficiation or upgradation involves handling three primary types of ROM material which have been blasted fragmented and brought out from an in situ position. These materials can be used directly or by simple or complex processing and even by applying extractive metallurgy like hydrometallurgical or pyrometallurgical methods.

The American Geosciences web site defines four main mining methods: underground open surface (pit) placer and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits.

There are four main mining methods: underground open surface (pit) placer and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits. Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits. Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels beach sands or other environments.
