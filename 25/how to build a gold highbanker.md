## Le Trap Home Highbanker / Recirc Project 
 · Another comment: The LeTrap is excellent at snagging fine gold. But it also is pretty big and requires a commensurate volume of water to make it run efficiently as a re-circulator [i.e. bilge pump or garden hose supply in the 1500 gph range or larger to adequately move the bulk of the tailings and black sands down and out of the sluice].

 · In order to increase the amount of gold I was getting had to upgrade to a highbanker. A full-size highbanker sluice isn't cheap so I set out to see if I could build my own using my old 36 inch aluminum stream sluice as the base.

A close relation of the dredge and sluice box the highbanker has the advantage of being able to work bench gravels left high and dry by river erosion which are unmined and may contain gold nuggets. The disadvantage of a highbanker is that it needs almost as much water as a sluice and needs a good sized motor and pump to move the water supply up from the river source to the high banker unit.

 · Legs and leg brackets. If you are going to build a double / extended sluice highbanker which you should you will often need 4 SETS of legs and leg brackets. These can easily run $25 – $35 a SET. It's not unusual to have $150 in just your LEG system. Then you still have to find a shop to make flares bend metal grizzly bars etc etc etc.

## Find More Gold by using a Highbanker 
 · Why a Highbanker? One of the first inventions for gold mining was the sluice box. The sluice box was used to filter materials so as to find gold. However the box had many shortcomings such as cumbersome and time consuming and it depended so much on the human energy. It required the proper setup and ideal water flows which are never a guarantee.
