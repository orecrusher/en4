CEMENT RAW MATERIALS - International Cement Review. The raw materials used in cement manufacture are extracted in large quarries typically with outputs of up to or over 2.5 million tonnes per year. Typically about 1.65 tonnes of limestone (1.5 to 1.8 tonnes) and 0.4 tonnes of clay are quarried for each tonne of cement produced.

## Raw Material Substitution 
The main raw material used in cement production has traditionally been limestone. Limestone is abundantly available but over 60% of the industry's CO 2 emissions are caused by transformation of limestone into lime called "decarbonation". Accordingly part of the route towards a low carbon concrete-built environment can involve limestone substitution.
