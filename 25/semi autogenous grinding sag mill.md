## AN OVERVIEW OF SINGLE STAGE AUTOGENOUS AND 
Over the years the design and operation of single stage autogenous and semi autogenous grinding mills has been a rather hit and miss affair with some great successes and some dismal failures with the majority of installation somewhere between. Yet the simplicity low capital and seemingly simple operation make this a circuit of choice for many.

## Autogenous mill and semi
Autogenous (AG) and semi-autogenous (SAG) mills have been used for over 20 years for the coarse grinding of diverse ores (including gold copper and iron ores). They offer advantages with regard to capital costs and operating expense compared to the secondary and tertiary crushers used in conventional size-reduction systems.
