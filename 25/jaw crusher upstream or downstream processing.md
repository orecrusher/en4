A Jaw Crusher is one of the main types of primary crushers in an ore processing or a mining plant. A Jaw Crusher lessens large size rocks or ore by having placed the rock into compression. A fixed jaw mounted in a "V" alignment is the stationary breaking surface whereas the mobile jaw exerts force on the rock by forcing it against the stationary plate.

## Tips to maximize crushing efficiency 
 · Ideally the feed rate should not be switched from choke to non-choke as this can cause problems downstream at the secondary processing plant. In practice many jaw crushers are fed in this intermittent fashion due to gaps in the delivery of feed material from the quarry. Additionally jaw crusher feed should be pre-screened using a grizzly

## Crushing in Mineral Processing
 · In mineral processing or metallurgy the first stage of comminution is crushing.. Depending of the type of rock (geometallurgy) to be crushed there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks. In principle compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear-resistant plate/surface.
