## How to Become a Mineralogist 
Most mineralogists study minerals of economic value such as metals like copper aluminum and iron ore as well as gypsum and clays. They determine their physical and chemical properties how to efficiently retrieve them from ores and how to process them.

## purifiion of copper by electrolysis metal extraction 
Low grade ores only contain small concentrations of copper and would not normally be considered economic to mine and process as would waste material from processing high grade copper ores. These two methods avoid traditional mining methods of digging moving and disposing of large amounts of rock - they make finite copper resources last longer and reduce the impact on the environment.

The process works best when the ore is crushed to small pieces before roasting. Additives such as common rock salt are often added to the mix before it is heated to enhance the reaction of the sulfides. Once the ores are fully roasted and the sulfur is driven off the extraction of the gold or silver from the ore is not especially difficult.

Different elements settle at different rates. Picture this: Gold ore has been crushed and screened to produce particles which are similar in size. Some of these particles are now liberated pieces of gold and others are minerals with little value. We now need to separate these particles in order to collect the gold.

## Pyrometallurgy 
Following mineral beneficiation which removes the non-ore components the ore itself must be broken down into its component value metals. Marine minerals can contain up to half a dozen economically desirable metals. In order to separate these metals individually a reduction process must occur to break the chemical framework of the ore.

 · Rare-earth element - Rare-earth element - Processing ores: All rare-earth ores contain less than 10 percent REO and must be upgraded to about 60 percent in order to be processed further. They are first ground to a powder and then separated from the other materials in the ore body by various standard processes that include magnetic and/or electrostatic separation and flotation.

They require a Plasma Cutter to cut them from the rock face. It takes 8 seconds to cut the mineral after which they can be picked up by hand. All minerals can be stacked up to 8 of the same type in one inventory slot.

About 80% of all copper extracted comes from sulphide ores. A typical ore contains only 0.5% to 2.0% copper. It is a measure of the value of copper that it is worth extracting it from such small concentrations. The ore is a mixture of minerals and rock (called gangue). The most common copper minerals are:

Mining is the extraction of minerals and elements of economic interest from the earth's surface. As the demand for natural resources increases the amount of material in mineral deposits decreases. An increase in price of these materials allows companies to continue to profit from mining deposits with lower ore grades.
