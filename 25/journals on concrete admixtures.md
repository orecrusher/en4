## Study of workability of fresh concrete 
The main issue in working with fresh concrete is the workability during filling of formwork. One of the problems found in workability is occurrence of segregation depending on w/c ratio. Segregation is strongly related to w/c ratio. The fresh concrete is usually considered as a non-Newtonian fluid since it is a mixture of aggregate cement and water.

## Effects of Water
 · Crushed Mangima stone as an alternative concrete aggregate has been studied and found to provide concrete with comparable compressive strength to that of the conventional concrete. This study investigated the effect of water-reducing admixtures in concrete production using crushed Mangima stone as fine aggregate. Waterreducing admixture with a variance of 0.5 1.0 and 1.5% by weight of cement

## Influence of Water
A miniature slump test has been developed for the evaluation of the influence of water-reducing admixtures on the workability of neat portland cement pastes. Resulting paste pat areas rather than heights are measured and the results are expressed as the percentage of water reduction.

## Admixtures in Concrete 
 · Admixtures are those ingredients in concrete other than portland cement water and aggregates that are added to the mixture immediately before or during mixing (Fig. 6-1). Admixtures can be classified by function as follows: Admixtures in Concrete. Air-entraining admixtures. Water-reducing admixtures.

The researchers investigated the usage molasses as a retarding admixture for concrete by comparing it to the conventional retarder specifically stuccotard 80. The same ratio of the retarders was used which is 300ml of retarder is to 100kg of cement concrete mixture used in this study and both followed a ratio of 1:2:4 for cement sand and gravel respectively.

## Advanced Quality Control Models for Concrete Admixtures 
Concrete admixtures are constantly used in construction projects and these admixtures can be used to increase/decrease the setting time improve workability enhance frost and sulfate resistance and to help control strength development. The quality of admixtures play a crucial role in altering fresh concrete properties.
