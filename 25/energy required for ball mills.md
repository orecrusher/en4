## Fact sheet Energy use in the steel industry
energy management systems ensure efficient use and recovery of energy throughout the steelmaking process for use within the steelworks boundary or exported from the site. Improvements in energy efficiency have led to reductions of about 60% in energy required to produce a tonne of crude steel since 1960 as demonstrated in Figure 1.1

## How Do Wind Turbines Work? 
 · A wind turbine turns wind energy into electricity using the aerodynamic force from the rotor blades which work like an airplane wing or helicopter rotor blade. When wind flows across the blade the air pressure on one side of the blade decreases. The difference in air pressure across the two sides of the blade creates both lift and drag.
