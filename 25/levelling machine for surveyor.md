## The Surveyor's Basic Tools
The surveyor uses a level to determine elevations. Levels fall into three broad egories: a "dumpy" level a "Wye" (or 'Y') level and "automatic" level. As with all tools of the surveyor there are various degrees of accuracy within each egory of level. A "dumpy" level has a telescope with cross hairs permanently mounted in a pair of arms.

## Levelling In Surveying 
Levelling is defined as the branch of surveying that is essentially used for determining the relative height of the different points on above and below the surface of the ground. The basic principle of levelling is to determine the horizontal line of sight with respect to which the vertical distances of the points below or above this line of sight are determined.
