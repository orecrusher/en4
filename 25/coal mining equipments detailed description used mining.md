## Equipment Selection for Surface Mining: A Review
A surface mine contains pits with mineral endowed rock (or ore). We extract ore that lies within the upper layer of the earth from surface mines (Fricke 2006)This ore can include metals such as iron copper coal and gold. There are several methods of surface mining including open-pit stripping dredging and mountain-top removal.
