## Rawmill 
A raw mill is the equipment used to grind raw materials into "rawmix" during the manufacture of cement. Rawmix is then fed to a cement kiln which transforms it into clinker which is then ground to make cement in the cement mill.The raw milling stage of the process effectively defines the chemistry (and therefore physical properties) of the finished cement and has a large effect upon the

History. Early hydraulic cements such as those of James Parker James Frost and Joseph Aspdin were relatively soft and readily ground by the primitive technology of the day using flat millstones.The emergence of Portland cement in the 1840s made grinding considerably more difficult because the clinker produced by the kiln is often as hard as the millstone material.
