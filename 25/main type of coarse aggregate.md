## Characteristics Of Aggregate 
The size of aggregate bigger than 4.75 mm is considered as coarse aggregates and less as fine aggregate or sand. The nominal sizes of coarse aggregate are 10 mm 20 mm etc. The shape of the particle depends on strength and abrasion resistance of the parent rock and the amount of wear to which it has been subjected.

Coarse aggregates are generally deï¬ ned as those retained on the 2.36-mm sieve. Fine aggregates are those that pass through the 2.36-mm sieve and are retained on the 0.075-mm sieve.

The process of concrete mix design is greatly influenced by the size of coarse aggregates to be used. 2. It is necessary to predict the quality and performance of the soil sample. 3.
