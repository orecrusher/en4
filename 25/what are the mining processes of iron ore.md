In 2011 the Financial Times quoted Christopher LaFemina mining analyst at Barclays Capital saying that iron ore is "more integral to the global economy than any other commodity except perhaps oil ".

## Mining of Iron Ores – IspatGuru
 · The process of mining consists of discovery of an iron ore deposit through extraction of iron ore and finally to returning the land to its natural state. It consists of several distinct steps. The first is discovery of the iron ore deposit which is carried out through prospecting or exploration to find and then define the extent loion and value of the ore body.

 · The per cent of iron in the ore as mined must be not less than 50% if it is to be used without being first improved (beneficiated) by cobbing washing calcining or magnetic concentration. Leaner ore is found in very large quantities; and in a favorable situation it may be workable by some concentrating process.

## Mining 
Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth. Some examples of substances that are mined include coal gold or iron ore.Iron ore is the material from which the metal iron is produced. The process of mining dates back to prehistoric times. Prehistoric people first mined flint which was ideal for tools and weapons since it breaks into shards with sharp edges.
