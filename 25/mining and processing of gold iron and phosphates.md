Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth. Some examples of substances that are mined include coal gold or iron ore.Iron ore is the material from which the metal iron is produced. The process of mining dates back to prehistoric times. Prehistoric people first mined flint which was ideal for tools and weapons since it breaks into shards with sharp edges.

## What Is Involved in Phosphate Mining? (with pictures)
Phosphate mining is an important part of the process of producing chemical fertilizers. The specific processes used to extract phosphate rock depend on the geographic characteristics of the area in which the mineral deposits are loed. Most phosphate mining is conducted as open-pit mining rather than subsurface mining.

 · Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining. The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however because iron does not occur naturally it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.

Gold recognizable by its yellowish cast is one of the oldest metals used by humans. As far back as the Neolithic period humans have collected gold from stream beds and the actual mining of gold can be traced as far back as 3500 B.C. when early Egyptians (the Sumerian culture of Mesopotamia) used mined gold to craft elaborate jewelry religious artifacts and utensils such as goblets.

Iron ores generally have higher grades than sulfide or gold ores often going over 50 per cent or more. Less tailings are therefore generally produced in iron ore projects. In gold and silver mines ore grades are generally in the range of grams per tonne.
