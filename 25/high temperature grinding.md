## Metallurgical Reasons for Grinding Cracks and Their 
Â Â· Grinding is often a final machining step to achieve desired surface finish or final dimensions. Grinding is a high-energy process where a lot of frictional energy is concentrated over a small region [1]. This localized energy is confined to the surface layers of the part being ground resulting in a local rise in the surface temperature.

Â Â· Grind Size. When coffee is ground finer it has more surface exposure. This means that extraction will happen more quickly. So if you're used to brewing with a medium roast and are trying out a light roast grind it a little finer. Likewise if you usually use light-roasted beans but are going darker use a coarser grind size.
