## Recovery of Some Critical Raw Materials from Processing 
Feldspar for ceramic/glass industries requires sufficiently low content of harmful colourants (Fe- Ti- Mn-bearing mineral phases). Hydrothermally altered albite-rich granites are increasingly used as feldspar raw material nowadays; however they are often marked by increased content of colourants which must be removed during the processing of feldspar ore.

## How mercury is made 
The ore is brought out of the mine on conveyor belts or in trucks or trains. Roasting Because cinnabar ore is relatively concentrated it can be processed directly without any intermediate steps to remove waste material. 2 The ore is first crushed in one or more cone crushers.
