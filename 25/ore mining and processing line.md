## HYBRIT – Towards Fossil
HYBRIT is a collaboration between LKAB SSAB and Vattenfall aiming towards a completely fossil-free process for iron- and steelmaking. Instead of coal hydrogen will be used to reduce LKAB's iron ore to iron – the biggest technological shift in iron- and steel production in a 1000 years. Play video. play-solo.

## Ore sorting: Efficiently optimise the treatment of ores in 
By using ore sorting equipment ore concentrates can be created at very low cost in small or remote mining installations. The entire processing line can be planned in semi-mobile form and consists only of crushers screens belts and sorting machines. This allows immense cost savings for transport since the waste rock is disposed of on-site.
