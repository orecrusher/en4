## Ball Mill Appliion and Design 
Ball mills are simple in design consisting of horizontal slow rotating vessels half filled with grinding media of ¼" to 1.5". The particles to be milled are trapped between the grinding media or balls and are reduced in size by the actions of impact and attrition. Ball mills have the advantage of being self-contained so operators are not exposed to the product being milled.
