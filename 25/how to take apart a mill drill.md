## Drilling Introduction Drill Press Work Area
Drilling Characteristics: The characteristics of drilling that set it apart from other powered metal cutting operations are: The chips must exit out of the hole created by the cutting. Chip exit can cause problems when chips are large and/or continuous. The drill can wander upon entrance and for deep holes.

## Drilling Design Rules 
Before adding drilled holes to a design ask yourself whether the hole is needed and/or whether it can be cast molded or pierced with sufficient accuracy instead of drilled. Specify standard drill bit sizes. Unusual hole sizes bring up the cost of manufacturing through purchasing and inventory costs. Through holes are preferred over blind holes.

## The Fast Track To High Speed Drilling 
 · With milling at least there is some room for maneuvering. Part of any speed increase can be devoted to taking lighter and more numerous cuts relaxing the strain on the overall process. Not so with drilling. Whether a given drill is run at conventional speed or "high speed" one pass still equals one hole. Fast or slow the tool path is the same.
