## Aluminum Toxicity 
Aluminum toxicity occurs when a person ingests or breathes high levels of aluminum into the body. Aluminum is the most plentiful metal in the earth's crust. It is present in the environment combined with other elements such as oxygen silicon and fluorine. Exposure to aluminum is usually not harmful but exposure to high levels can cause serious health problems.

Before mining can commence the land needs to be cleared of timber and vegetation. Alongside this process may be the collection of seeds and/or saplings for inclusion in a seedbank which will form the basis of post-mining revegetation of the site. Next the top soil is removed and is usually also stored for replacement during rehabilitation.
