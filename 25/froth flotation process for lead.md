Sphalerite generally does not float well with xanthate collectors especially short xanthate collectors. So to be able to float sphalerite it should be activated by a metal at a certain PH. Some of the metals that can do the job are copper and lead. At a pH between 8-9 lead can activate sphalerite to cause it flotation.

Roasting is a process of heating a sulfide ore to a high temperature in presence of air. It is a step of the processing of certain ores.More specifically roasting is a metallurgical process involving gas–solid reactions at elevated temperatures with the goal of purifying the metal component(s). Often before roasting the ore has already been partially purified e.g. by froth flotation.

## Froth Flotation 
Froth flotation was invented in the early 1900s in Australia by C.V. Potter and around the same time by G.D. Deprat. The process was adapted and applied to a wide variety of materials to be separated. In the 1960s the flotation technique was adapted for deinking recycled paper.
