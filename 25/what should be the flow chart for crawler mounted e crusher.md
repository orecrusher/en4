Jaw crushers offer reduction ratios of up to about 6:1 while cone crushers can reduce material size up to a maximum of 8:1 ratio. The finer the crushing the smaller the reduction ratio. As a basic rule jaw crushers are the primary crusher taking the mined aggregate and reducing it to a size that a cone crusher can accept.
