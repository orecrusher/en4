## Mining Technology in the Nineteenth Century 
Miners used mechanical crushing and grinding machines to break up ores for further processing. Early miners used Mexican arrastras or stamp mills which reached their peak in the late nineteenth century to crush ores into sand-size particles. Before going to stamp mills ores often went through rock crushers which were like nutcrackers.
