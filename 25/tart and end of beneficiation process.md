 · The first step in many extraction processes is to create an enriched preconcentrate that has been removed of unwanted materials or materials that are valuable for another process. This beneficiation step is not only important for the future hydrometallurgical processing of the ore but economically as well since these impurities may hinder the final recovery and grade of the desired

## Stages of transcription: initiation elongation 
Transcription is the first step of gene expression. During this process the DNA sequence of a gene is copied into RNA. Before transcription can take place the DNA double helix must unwind near the gene that is getting transcribed. The region of opened-up DNA is called a transcription bubble.
