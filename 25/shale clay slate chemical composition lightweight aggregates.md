 · Synthetic lightweight aggregates are typically produced by a rotary kiln process using natural materials such as clay shale or slate. The kiln products can be directly sieved to aggregate size fractions or can be crushed prior to screening. The obtained aggregate sizes can also be further blended to achieve a desired size gradation prior to use.

Normal-weight aggregates are typically natural crushed stone whereas lightweight aggregates are produced by heating clay shale or slate in a rotary kiln at temperatures on the order of 2000°F. At these temperatures the aggregates expand and develop a network of interconnected internal pores (Figure 1) ranging in size from 5 to 300 microns (Chua 2009).
