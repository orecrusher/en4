Levelling in surveying and construction is important because gravity is by far the most significant force affecting our everyday life. Working parallel and perpendicular to the force of gravity is fundamental in designing and constructing the homes we live in the roads we cycle or drive on the bridges we cross and the office blocks we work in.
