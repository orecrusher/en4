Nickel: smelting; Extraction and purifiion; Nickel is recovered through extractive metallurgy: it is extracted from its ores by conventional roasting and reduction processes that yield a metal of greater than 75% purity. In many stainless steel appliions 75% pure nickel can be used without further purifiion depending on the composition of the impurities.
