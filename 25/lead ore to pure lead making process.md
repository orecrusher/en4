 · You can remove the most common metals found in gold ore (copper zinc and lead) using elements that bond with oxygen at lower temperatures than gold. This oxidation process will make copper oxide zinc oxide and lead oxide — all of which are less dense than pure gold and will float to the top of your crucible allowing the slag to be sloughed off.
