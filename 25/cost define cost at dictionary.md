 · A reader has asked about the use of these two terms: I was wondering if you would care to comment on the difference between cost-efficient and cost-effective.In both Oxford and Webster (the free online versions) cost-effective is properly defined while the cost-efficient page points to that of cost-effective.It looks like cost-efficient is a tolerated synonym of a lesser status.

## Cost definition and meaning 
Cost: Something of value usually an amount of money given up in exchange for something else usually goods or services. All expenses are costs but not all costs are expenses.

## Cost
 · As always my starting place is The Oxford English Dictionary. There I find a reference to cost-effective in the entry for cost: cost-effective adj. designating or pertaining to a project etc. that is effective in terms of its cost. The first OED citation given for cost-effective is dated 1967. I find no entry for cost-efficient.
