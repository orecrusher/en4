4. Turn on the machine power by turning the switch to the "ON" position. Then press the green button to start the spindle. 5. Move the grinding wheel down using the vertical table handwheel until it barely makes contact with the dresser. 6. Turn the machine off after making contact with the dresser. 7. Turn the machine on again.

## What is CNC Machining? Working Principles Available Methods
 · So we now know how CNC machines work. But not all these machines are used for CNC machining. We will take a closer look at all the different types of CNC machines that are available a little later. But in a traditional sense CNC machining refers to only a few of these automated processes. Namely milling turning grinding routing drilling etc.

NOTE: Varying the work speed is perhaps the most conv~nient and effective way to modify the operational conditions in cylindrical grinding. The implementation of work speed variations is facilitated by the infinitely variable workhead speeds extending over a wide range which are available on modern cylindrical grinding machines.

## Grinding Machines 
Surface grinding machines for ceramics can be divided into (1) creep-feed grinding type and (2) reciproing (speed-stroke) grinding type. Reciproing grinding works with relatively small depth of cut and high speeds (up to 40000 mm/min) and requires particular specifiions of the driving system such as high damping and acceleration.

 · Mixer grinders usually work for a good 8 – 10 years or even more without giving any trouble. If you notice that the appliance has a loose blade in the jar you can tighten the blade assembly using a screwdriver. If tightening the blade assembly doesn't help it's possible that the gun metal (part attached to the mixer grinder unit) is faulty.

## How Does A CNC Cylindrical Grinding Machine Work?
A grinding machine or grinder is an industrial power tool that uses an abrasive wheel for cutting or removing the m aterial. It is a process of metal cutting by using a rotating abrasive whee l from the surface of the workpiece. Generally the grinding is finishing operation to show the high surface quality accuracy of the shape and dimension.

## Understanding Grinding Fluid 
 · "In machining we tend to think that softer materials will benefit from higher lubricity and harder materials will require higher cooling capabilities. The same is true for grinding" said Foster. "For example grinding oil with active sulfur or chlorine will be effective in reducing heat generation and providing a good finish but the cooling ability will be relatively poor."
