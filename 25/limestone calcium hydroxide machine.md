 · In the new process the pulverized limestone is dissolved in the acid at one electrode and high-purity carbon dioxide is released while calcium hydroxide generally known as lime precipitates out as a solid at the other. The calcium hydroxide can then be processed in another step to produce the cement which is mostly calcium silie.

Calcium hydroxide is also used as a pesticide in fruit growing. Here it is used for example as a fungicide (agent against fungal infections such as tree cancer). Lime water is the (almost) saturated solution of calcium hydroxide and serves as a clear liquid for the detection of carbon dioxide through the formation of calcium carbonate which precipitates and makes the solution cloudy.
