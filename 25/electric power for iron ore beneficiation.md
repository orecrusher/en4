## Beneficiation 
Beneficiation is followed by processing activities such as smelting and refining. The beneficiation process begins with milling which is followed by flotation for further beneficiation. At the first stage extracted ores undergo the milling operation to produce uniformly sized particles for crushing grinding wet or dry concentration.
