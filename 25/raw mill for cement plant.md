The raw mix is fed into a circular storage unit called a raw mix storage. Then the mix is extracted transversely from the stockpile by reclaimers and conveyed to a raw mill bin called the raw mix bin for grinding. The other raw materials that are used in cement manufacturing called additives are high purity limestone sand and iron ore.

Mills belong to a class of equipments that accomplish comminution of materials in the fine range. There are two types of mills which are mostly used in cement plants for grinding raw mix viz. Ball mills and VRM. Ball mills Ball mills are essentially fine grinding units capable of grinding material to a fineness say 84% passing 90 microns.
