Corrosion is an electrochemical process involving the flow of charges (electrons and ions). At active sites on the bar called anodes iron atoms lose electrons and move into the surrounding concrete as ferrous ions. This process is called a half-cell oxidation reaction or the anodic reaction and is represented as: 2Fe → 2Fe 2+ + 4e-

Cast Iron Versus Steel: Authentic cannon balls and smaller solid shot (canister and grape) are made of cast-iron rather than steel. The Federal Ordnance Manual of 1862 stated that all shot and shell were to be fabried from cast-iron with only one exception (lead).. How are they cast? The casting of solid shot and shell is well covered in Dean Thomas' book Cannons.

1800's up until the late 1960's was manufactured from cast iron. The first cast iron pipe manufacturing process consisted of pouring molten iron into a sand mold which stood on end in a pit in the ground similar to how concrete is poured into a form. Pipe manufactured by this method is referred to today as "pit" cast iron pipe.

## How Is Cast Iron Made? 
 · Contaminants are removed from the melted pig iron and the iron once melted is then cast. Casting is the process of pouring the iron into a mold thus giving it a shape. Molds and pouring methods divide this process up. Molds can be made as expendable molds (sand) or non-expendable molds (metal). Pouring can happen via gravity low-pressure or

## Cast Iron Pipe 
Cast iron. Cast iron is less expensive than steel and in some cases more corrosion resistant. It is commonly used for underground water service. The use of cast iron pipe is generally undesirable in oil or gas service because of its brittleness. If heated by fire and then quenched cast iron can fail.
