## Hopper Design Principles 
 · A screw that has a constant pitch and diameter (and a constant shaft diameter) will give rise to the formation of a flow channel at the back of the hopper over the first flight of the screw. As shown in Figure 13 this channel will draw material from the top surface into the flow channel until a stable rathole forms and the channel empties.
