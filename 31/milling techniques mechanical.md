## Milling Process Defects Equipment
End milling - An end mill makes either peripheral or slot cuts determined by the step-over distance across the workpiece in order to machine a specified feature such as a profile slot pocket or even a complex surface contour.The depth of the feature may be machined in a single pass or may be reached by machining at a smaller axial depth of cut and making multiple passes.

– Climb mill with this 2/3's cut ratio. Conventional milling with a face mill causes the chip to start out thin which sometimes leads to rubbing at the outset of chip formation that is bad for surface finish and can lead to BUE. The best finishes start the chip out fat and then thin it out before the chip releases.

Milling was then performed in 80% ethanol for 30–120 minutes using a high-energy ball mill. The mechanical treatment resulted in a reduction of the fibre length and diameter probably due to degradation of the cellulose amorphous regions. Fibrillation was helped by the wet environment which facilitated the intra-fibre swelling.
