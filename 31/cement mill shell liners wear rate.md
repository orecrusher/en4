1. Liners protect the outer shell of the mill from wear - liners are renewable. 2. Lifters prevent slipping between the medium and slurry charge in the mill and the mill shell. Slippage will consume energy wastefully but more importantly it will reduce the ab ility of the mill shell to transmit energy to the tumbling charge.
