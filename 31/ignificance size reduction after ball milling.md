## significant size reduction after ball milling
The objective of milling is to reduce the particle size and blending of particles in new phases. The different type of ball milling can be used for synthesis of nanomaterials in which balls impact upon the powder charge 1There was a significant reduction in Al 2 O 3 grain size after 24h milling up to 27nm and approached the alloy grain

## Head Milling 101: The Basics of Head Milling to Gain 
 · Milling involves removing material from the cylinder head (or block deck surface where the heads and block meet) to effectively reduce the volume of the combustion chambers. This method which is also used to correct warped or imperfect deck surfaces allows you to control the size of the chamber so you can get the volume needed to achieve a desired compression ratio.

 · From the XRD pattern the initially sharp diffraction lines are considerably broadened after ball milling due to a decrease in the particle size and an increase in internal lattice strains. The peak broadening of XRD peaks particularly (102202) peak and creation of particles of sizes ~15nm are features suggestive of creation of nano-decagonal phase.

 · The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 – 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size. The large balls tend to break down the coarse feed materials and the smaller balls help to form fine product by reducing void spaces between the balls. Ball mills grind material by impact and attrition.

Ball mills give a controlled final grind and produce flotation feed of a uniform size. Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5–10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel.
