The balls also tumble over each other exerting a shearing action on the feed material. This combination of impact and shearing forces brings about a very effective size reduction. Ball sizes are usually in the range 1 – 6 inches. Small balls give more point contacts but larger balls give greater impact.

## Ball Mill 
Ball mills give a controlled final grind and produce flotation feed of a uniform size. Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5–10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel.
