## Assess the Quality of Sand Used for Your Home Construction 
Assessing the quality of sand is a great idea to ensure the best construction. Sand is said to have more impact on the strength of the construction. The building may develop cracks or damages with use of improper quality of sand. Like any other material there are certain features that determine the quality of sand. Good quality sand should not possess more than 4% of silt content. It should

 · We understand that leaving too many stones in the soil will reduce the capacity of the soil to hold moisture and can also prevent tree roots from forming normally so we're considering sieving the soil somehow. It sounds like the local landscaping contractors can't help us with sieving so I suppose it will have to be done manually.
