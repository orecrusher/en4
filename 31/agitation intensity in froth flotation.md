## Froth_flotation 
Froth flotation is a selective process for separating minerals from gangue by using surfactants and wetting agents. The selective separation of the minerals makes processing complex (that is mixed) ores economically feasible. The flotation process is used for the separation of a large range of sulfides carbonates and oxides prior to further refinement.
