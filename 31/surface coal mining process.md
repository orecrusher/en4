## What is Surface Mining? (with pictures) 
Quarry mining is one type of surface mining. Strip mining is a form of surface mining that is primarily used for coal excavation. The rock and dirt covering the ore is removed one strip at a time. Once the ore has been taken from the first strip a second strip is cut next to it and the waste from the second strip is used to back fill the first.
