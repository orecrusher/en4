## Crushed Stone Aggregates 
Crushed stone aggregates are produced by crushing quarried rock then screening it to sizes appropriate for the intended use. Production of crushed stone has three stages: Primary crushing to break down the stone to a manageable size; secondary and tertiary crushing to render the rocks into sizes specific to their appliions; and screening to separate the crushed stone for further
