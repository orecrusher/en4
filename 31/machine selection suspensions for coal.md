 · Coal surface properties like the properties of any other solid can be studied via wettability measurements. This involves measurement of contact angle (Θ) with the use of liquid with known surface tension (γ L).The work of adhesion of liquid to solid (W SL) is given by [12.1] W SL = γ L 1 + cos θ = W SL LW + W SL ABwhere W SL LW and W SL AB stand for the Lifshits–van der Waals
