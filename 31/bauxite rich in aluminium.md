## Bauxite 
Bauxite is the most important aluminium ore. It consists largely of the minerals gibbsite Al(OH) 3 boehmite γ-AlO(OH) and diaspore α-AlO(OH) together with the iron oxides goethite and hematite the clay mineral kaolinite and small amounts of anatase TiO 2.It was named after the village Les Baux-de-Provence in southern France where it was first discovered in 1821 by geologist Pierre Berthier.

Bauxite forms by the weathering of aluminum-rich and silica-poor rocks in hot humid climates at places with good drainage. Under the proper conditions weathering disintegrates the aluminium silie minerals and dissolves and removes the silica creating bauxite. The mined US bauxite deposits have all been in the southeastern United States.

 · Bauxite is mainly used to extract aluminum. About 85% of bauxite can be refined into alumina and then smelted into aluminum 8% for chemical alumina and 7% for refractory materials proppants and cement. Because of different grades of the ores you can get 2 tons of alumina from 4-6 tons of bauxite and 1ton aluminum from 2 tons of alumina.
