## Effects of Appliion of Iron Ore tailing in Soil on the 
Iron ore tailings are the remained rock mineral debris after the useful metals such as iron are elected from the raw iron ore which goes through the beneficiation process of crushing screening grinding grading and then re-election flotation or cyanide while mining (Chen Hu et al. 2012). They are usually stacked in the tailings pond of a mine.

tailings. Iron ore tailings containing around 48 - 60% Fe are generated from the iron ore washing plants and are disposed into tailing ponds without any further utility. These tailings in the form of slimes are not suitable in iron and steel making due to the presence of higher amount of gangue constituents.

In this classical approach iron values were lost in the form of fines and utrafines into the tailing ponds as they had little commercial value in those days and accumulated in huge quantities over the years.

## Assessment of Effective Design of Tailing Pond for Safe 
Tailing ponds for the containment of iron ore tailings is an important issue not only from the point of view of pollution control but also from the conservation of resources for the future. But due to huge cost of land and safety of the dam it is worth designing an appropriate tailing pond size to a minimum level.
