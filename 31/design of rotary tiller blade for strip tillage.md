Strip Tillage - It is a tillage system in which only isolated bands of soil are tilled. Rotary Tillage -It is the tillage operations employing rotary action to cut break and mix the soil. Mulch Tillage -It is the preparations of soil in such a way that plant residues or other mulching materials are specially left on or near the surface.

In order to design a rotary tiller the special work of the tiller and also the performable work of the tractor should be determined. The specific work of rotary tiller is defined as the work carried on by rotary tiller at each rotation of tillage blades per the volume of broken soil which could be calculated by the following equation [13]: 0
