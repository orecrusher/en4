## Gold extraction 
Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution mineral processing hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.. Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold panning and sluicing resulting in direct recovery of

Gold cyanidation also called cyanide leaching is a process used to extract gold from raw ore taken from the ground. It uses cyanide to dissolve the gold within the rock which itself is not soluble in cyanide. The gold is then drawn out in a liquid form that can be treated to remove the cyanide. Almost 90% of all gold extracted commercially
