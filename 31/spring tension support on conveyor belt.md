## Conveyor Tension and Take
Tension in a conveyor belt is fundamental to its very operation in terms of supporting the load between rollers and enabling the drive to impart motion to it. For a conveyor on the verge of slipping there is a direct ratio between T1 the traction force imparted to the Conveyor and T2 the Take-Up Tension of a Conveyor Belt. This ratio is of the

 · Adjust the belt tension with a "test weight" (the maximum weight the curve conveyor is designed for) ensuring that the equipment can operate without any slipping between the belt and pulleys. When doing this it is important to ensure the belt tension is not set too high or too low. This could lead to problems when adjusting the belt path.

The difference between the maximum working tension and the ultimate tensile strength of the belt is often referred to as the service factor. On top quality domestic conveyor belting this service factor is 8-10 to 1.
