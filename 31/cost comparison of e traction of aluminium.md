## Aluminium – Analysis 
Primary aluminium production involves two key steps: alumina refining to refine bauxite ore into alumina (aluminium oxide) and aluminium smelting to convert alumina to pure aluminium. The drop in alumina refining energy intensity was less in 2018 (‑1.8%) than during 2010‑17 (average ‑3.0% per year); aluminium smelting also decreased at a slightly lower rate (-0.4%) compared with the

## Energy needed to produce aluminum 
 · Compared to the energy requirements of primary production secondary production is much less energy intensive. The figure below shows average annual U.S. aluminum production and net imports of finished aluminum. Production fluctuates considerably to meet U.S. aluminum demand which changes with economic conditions.
