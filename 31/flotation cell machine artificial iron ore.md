## Flotation Cells in Iron Ore Processing 
To answer your question I think it's best to consider the anatomy of forced air vs. induced air (e.g. WEMCO) flotation cells. The induced air flotation cell has the rotor position at the top of the cell as it needs to be close to the surface to pull in air; hence the majority of the mixing energy is dissipated in the top of the cell.
