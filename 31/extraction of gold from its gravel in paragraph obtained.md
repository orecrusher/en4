## Extracting Gold 
Removing the gold-bearing rock from the ground is just the first step. To isolate pure gold mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel.

 · In the preceding example the 50 milligrams of gold would have been obtained from a cylinder of gravel exactly 7½ inches in diameter by 32 feet long. But in practice a perfect core is rare and we find the measured core rise and the volume of material recovered from each drive to be greater or less than their theoretical amounts.
