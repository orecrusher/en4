## How phosphate is mined and processed
But humans then started mining phosphorus from both igneous and sedimentary (but mostly sedimentary) rock. The use of inorganic phosphate fertilizer (aka chemical fertilizer) greatly altered the phosphorus cycle as shown in this second diagram. Phosphorus in rock is pretty insoluble and thus not directly available to plants. In nature
