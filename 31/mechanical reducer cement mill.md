 · Hammer Mill Crusher. The Dixie (Non-Clog) Hammer Mill Crusher differs from all other hammermills in that its breaker plate instead of being stationary is a continuously moving belt of manganese steel links. The feed thrown into the hopper is carried by a positive mechanical feed to the hammer-points and then on through the grates.
