## Determination of grinding aids in portland cement by 
 · Introduction. Energy utilization during the grinding process of Portland cement clinker and gypsum can be significantly improved by adding polar organic compounds (referred to as grinding aids) in concentrations less than 500 ppm .Because of their highly polar nature grinding aid compounds preferentially adsorb on surfaces formed by the fracture of electrovalent bonds (i.e. Ca-O and Si-O).
