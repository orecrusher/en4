In the second studies when pet was used to replace quarry dust partially the compressive strength was a little bit lower than the control. its water absorption was less and it also had good resistance to acid. from the above findings pet pavement blocks have a good strength and can therefore be used for any construction work.

 · The quarry dust sizes of 0/4.75 mm via BS (British Standard) sieve size were used for the subsequent laboratory tests. According to the Cement and Concrete Institute continuous grading usually facilitates compaction. For this reason - paving blocks usually made from semi-dry mixes chunky particle shape will expedite compaction.
