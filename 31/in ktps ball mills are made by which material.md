## High energy ball milling process for nanomaterial synthesis
Besides materials synthesis high-energy ball milling is a way of modifying the conditions in which chemical reactions usually take place either by changing the reactivity of as-milled solids (mechanical activation — increasing reaction rates lowering reaction temperature of the ground powders)—or by inducing chemical reactions during milling (mechanochemistry).

## Milling 
Ball Mills. Ball mills operate by introducing the material to be milled into a rotating vessel which contains grinding media (e.g. high-density balls or rods) and the material is ground by attrition through the tumbling action of the mill.

## What is paint and how is it made 
Ball mills are large porcelain lined rotating drums containing golf ball sized porcelain balls. Rolling and tumbling of the balls provides sufficient force to break up agglomerates. Bead mills are used for large batches and can maintain semi-continuous output. Operation is similar to a ball mill but the vessel is smaller and balls are 3mm
