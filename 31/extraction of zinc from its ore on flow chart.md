 · Sphalerite: The Primary Ore. Sphalerite (zinc sulfide) is the primary ore mineral from which most of the world's zinc is produced but a number of other minerals that do not contain sulfide contain zinc as a major component. Much of the early zinc production was from nonsulfide deposits; however as these resources were exhausted production shifted to sulfide deposits.
