110. Weight of an Hourglass. Does the weight of an hourglass change when the sand is falling? This demo shows the truth! A funnel with the sand held back by a cork and string arrangement is perched to drop sand into a glass beaker on a double pan balance. A laser bounces a beam off a small mirror attached to the pointer of the balance.

 · Hopper dredges are primarily used for maintenance dredging in exposed harbors and shipping channels namely where traffic and operating conditions negate the use of stationary dredges. Hopper dredges are most effective when excavating loose unconsolidated materials that form shoals following the completion of initial dredging .

## sand from a stationary hopper falls on a moving conveyor belt
Sand from a stationary hopper falls onto a moving conveyor belt at the rate of 5.00 kg/s as in Figure P9.72. The conveyor belt is supported by frictionless rollers and moves at a constant speed of 0.750 m/s under the action of a constant horizontal external force F ext supplied by the motor that drives the belt.
