## How is coal mined and extracted? 
After the coal is brought up to the surface by conveyors it undergoes a process that removes sand and mud by immersing the coal in a solution of water and tiny magnetite particles. The different elements separate naturally. The coal floats while the other ores called tails sink to the bottom.

Coal is a black or brownish-black sedimentary rock that can be burned for fuel and used to generate electricity.It is composed mostly of carbon and hydrocarbons which contain energy that can be released through combustion (burning). Coal is the largest source of energy for generating electricity in the world and the most abundant fossil fuel in the United States.

The stereotypical grizzled gold-rush prospector panning for gold was searching for "placer gold" or gold deposited in a waterway. Placer mining takes a variety of forms including panning "sluice-boxing" hydraulic mining and dredging. All of these techniques use gravity and water to separate the dense gold from the lighter sand and gravel.

Gold smelting flux helps us to take advantage of this fact in the smelting process. Flux is able to react only with the impure metals thereby causing them to form nitrates which can separate out neatly. Again smelting flux makes metallic oxides easy to eliminate thereby removing another major source of impurity.
