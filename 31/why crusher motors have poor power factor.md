 · Overheating can be caused by poor power quality or a high temperature operating environment. For every 10oc that the temperature of a motor rises the insulation life reduced by 50%. Possible solution: It is critical that the motor is kept as cool as possible ensuring the operating environment is kept cool if possible will help prevent breakdowns.

## Understanding Power Factor and why it's important 
Understanding Power Factor and why it's important. Power factor is the relationship (phase) of current and voltage in AC electrical distribution systems. Under ideal conditions current and voltage are "in phase" and the power factor is "100%.". If inductive loads (motors) are present power factor less than 100% (typically 80 to 90%

## Motor Efficiency and Power Factor 
More than half of all electric energy generated goes to power electric motors. Electric motor converts electric power into shaft power. In thermodynamics terms this is simply converting work from one form to another. The Second Law allows electric motors to have a theoretical efficiency of 100%.

 · Abstract: The performance of a synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) depends on the direct-axis inductance (L d) and the quadrature-axis inductance (L q) of the machine.Increasing the saliency ratio L d /L q and making the difference between these inductances (L d-L q) large are well known methods for achieving high torque density and power factor.

## Do VFDs really improve the power factor of AC motors?
 · Variable frequency drives typically have very high PF D values. This is because the DC bus capacitors supply the necessary reactive current to the motor for inducing the rotor's magnetic field and the AC supply line only has to supply real power. This means voltage and current remain almost perfectly in phase with very little displacement and the power factor can be at or near unity.

With capacitive loads (such as capacitor banks) the current leads the voltage therefore they have a leading power factor.

## Low Power Factor Operation of Induction Motor 
 · Generally an Induction motors operates at low power factor (approx pf 0.2 to 0.4) during light load or no load condition and at full load (approx pf 0.8 to 0.9). At low load or no load condition because of presence of only magnetizing current in the stator windings causes low power factor operation of the power system since magnetizing current is highly inductive in nature.

## Power factor correction – What is it? Why is it required 
Power factor correction is obtained via the connection of capacitors which produce reactive energy in opposition to the energy absorbed by loads such as motors locally close to the load. This improves the power factor from the point where the reactive power source is connected preventing the unnecessary circulation of current in the network.
