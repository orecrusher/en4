Gold can be extracted by washing only when it is present as metal in the form of particles which are not too minute. The washing removes the specifically lighter parts of the material the heavier gold particles sinking to the bottom. The process is applicable directly to gold- bearing sand and to gold-bearing rocks after crushing.

## Processes 
The gravity concentration separation process gets more complex as the specific gravities between the valuable mineral and the gangue get closer. For example complex gold in a sulphide complex of pyrite must isolate a specific gravity of 19.3 for gold from 5.2 for pyrite. Using gravity to recover minerals in their coarsest fraction minimises

## What is the Alluvial Gold Mining Method?
 · The most commonly used alluvial gold mining methods are gravity separation method froth flotation method amalgamation method. Among them gravity separation method is the main method used in the alluvial gold mining which is also proved to be an effective and economical alluvial gold mining method.

## The Metallurgy of Cyanide Gold Leaching – An Introduction 
 · Nature of Gold: The surface of a gold particle will typically be dissolved at a rate of around 0.2-0.5 µm of surface depth per hour in a cyanide leach. For large gold particles and nuggets this is too slow to be fully dissolved in a typical processing plant. Much simpler and less expensive gravity methods are available to recover this gold.
