Oil has been used for lighting purposes for many thousands of years. In areas where oil is found in shallow reservoirs seeps of crude oil or gas may naturally develop and some oil could simply be collected from seepage or tar ponds. Historically we know the tales of eternal fires where oil and gas seeps ignited and burned.

## Thermal degradation of PVC: A review 
 · During the alytic dehydrochlorination the chloro-organic compounds in oil can be effectively removed whereas the carbon number distribution of the fuel oil did not change considerably. In a parallel study ( Lingaiah et al. 2001a ) alytic dechlorination of PVC-containing mixed plastic-derived oil was performed using iron oxide and iron oxide–carbon composite alysts.

## LOSS ON HEATING OF OIL AND ASPHALTIC COMPOUNDS ASTM 
Loss on heating of oil and asphaltic compounds is the rate (expressed in %) between sample loss of mass and its initial mass. This method determines loss on heating of oil and asphaltic compounds (exclusive of water) when they are weighed heated at 163°C for 5 hours in a ventilated oven and weighed again to determine their loss of mass.

Poke through a food substance measuring 0.5 grams using the needle with the handle. Turn on fire on the burner. Set the food substance on the needle to fire on the burner. Once the food substance starts to burn place it under the test tube so the water inside it can absorb heat. Measure the temperature change in the water using the thermometer.

The aqueous phase tends to cool faster than the oil phase and may cause premature solidifiion of some ingredients. However use the lowest temperature possible and keep the time of heating as short as possible. This will minimize the quantity of water lost through evaporation.
