Dicalcium phosphate is commonly produced through the "wet acid" route in which rock phosphate is reacted with sulphuric acid to produce phosphoric acid. After concentration and purifiion (to reduce the level of impurities) phosphoric acid is reacted with a calcium source (commonly quick lime or limestone) to produce dicalcium phosphate.

## Dewatering of phosphorus extracted from liquid swine waste
Sludge rich in calcium phosphate (> 20% P2O5) was obtained using a field prototype and it was further dewatered using a combination of polymer treatment and filter bags. Anionic polyacrylamide polymer treatment (> or = 20 mg/L) was effective to flocculate the P-rich sludge which enhanced filtration and dewatering.
