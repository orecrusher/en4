## Natural Gold Indiors (Part 1) 
 · Mining reports will often mention if gold veins occur in the quartz. Another thing worth noting about the quartz is that the kind of quartz that gold is generally found in is not pure white. Most commonly it will show significant iron staining and the quartz will have a dirty appearance with reddish/brown stains.

 At least eight of the mines boasted total production in excess of ounces. Overall hardrock mining accounted for about 60 of the gold produced in the Mother Lode and Sierra Foothills. The most serious problem of mining the gold veins themselves was that quart the host ore was an extremely hard mineral.

Other apparently related Au-bearing quartz veins in northeastern Oregon differ from the above districts in their higher sulfide content and higher silver grade. Recently Bliss (1994) suggested that all of the mesothermal vein deposits in northeastern Oregon represent a distinct deposit-type although he noted the similarity of some of the above deposits to the low-sulfide Au-quartz vein

Because quartz and gold may be deposited together across a considerable range of temperatures not all quartz veins are the same and there are several different types of gold-quartz deposits. Those deposits formed of solutions that flowed at higher temperatures are distinguished by their own suite of gangue minerals such as tourmaline apatite garnet biotite and amphiboles in addition to

Oregon Mines - Mining Artifacts. The placer miners discovered most of the gold-bearing quartz ledges in the area and hard rock mining began in the Sumpter Valley and the surrounding mountains. About 1895 Sumpter began to grow due to the changes in mining technology and new methods to chemically extract the gold from its alloys.
