## BOILER INTERVIEW QUESTION ANSWER 
 · Q.(A).What is the affect of sulfur in coal when used in boiler? Sulfur will get oxidized to SO2 and fraction of SO3 and will react with water to form sulfuric acid and this occurs at a temperature called the acid dew point which normally is about 120 oC. The sulfuric acid so formed corrodes the steel when it comes in contact with it.
