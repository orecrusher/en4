## Dry Iron Ore Beneficiation 
 · Iron ore extraction is mainly performed through open pit mining operations resulting in significant tailings generation. The iron ore production system usually involves three stages: mining processing and pelletizing activities. Of these processing ensures that an adequate iron grade and chemistry is achieved prior to the pelletizing stage.
