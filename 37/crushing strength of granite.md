The granite maul is a two-handed melee weapon that requires 50 Strength and Attack to wield. They are dropped by gargoyles (75 Slayer required) which are in the Slayer Tower.. Players can use an ornate maul handle obtained from Justine's stuff for the Last Shopper Standing to enhance the granite maul reducing its special attack cost from 60% to 50%. This causes it to become untradeable.

## Granite 
Granite (/ ˈ ɡ r æ n. ɪ t /) is a coarse-grained intrusive igneous rock composed mostly of quartz alkali feldspar and plagioclase.It forms from magma with a high content of silica and alkali metal oxides that slowly cools and solidifies underground. It is common in the continental crust of Earth where it is found in various kinds of igneous intrusions.
