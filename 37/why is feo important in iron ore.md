 · The burden starts to soften. Iron and slag separate. The FeO content in slag phase can vary inside a large range e.g. 5–25%. Metallic iron is carbonized by carbon in the coke and CO gas and melts at 1200–1300 °C. Molten iron and slag drip down through the coke layer to the hearth where they reach their final temperature and composition.
