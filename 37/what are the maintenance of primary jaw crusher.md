## Jaw Crushers 
Jaw crushers are typically used as primary crushers because they can take large and variable sized feed material so the original feed won't have to be blasted down to a fine size. Powerscreen jaws are designed to be significantly more reliable and have lower wear rates maximizing production and minimizing wear parts.
