## A new method for gravity separation: Vibrating table 
Abstract This paper discusses recently developed gravity concentration equipment namely vibrating table and reports detailed descriptions of the equipment in terms of principles of design and their effects on operational parameters. Vibrating table originally combines the known physical phenomena of a teetered bed resistance to water flow vibration and density differences.

 · Separation methods based on gravity or density can be used to improve the quality of ore for DRI. Particles of different densities are separated in a medium of intermediate density such as a suspension of fine heavy particles in water; in a solution of a salt such as calcium chloride and various bromides; or a in a true "heavy liquid" such as a thallium malonate/formate solution.

This potential is greatest for separation of minerals at finer particle size ranges where unit gravity devices such as spirals lose effectiveness. The higher g-forces (ranging as high as 600 g's) used in recent pilot and plant tests has further contributed to recognizing the potential of centrifugal gravity concentration in new appliions.

 · Another method that is used to separate oil from water is absorbance. This method separates oil from water by using absorbent materials to soak up the oil. One of the most common materials used for this oil and water separation method is polypropylene. This type of material is ideal for this approach due to its water repelling nature (hydrophobic).

Filtration. Filtration is a separation method used to separate out pure substances in mixtures comprised of particles some of which are large enough in size to be captured with a porous material.Particle size can vary considerably given the type of mixture. For instance stream water is a mixture that contains naturally occurring biological organisms like bacteria viruses and protozoans.
