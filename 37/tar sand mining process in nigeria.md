## Oil Sands Processing 
 · Oil sands are a combination of sand clay and water that contain a heavy crude oil variant called bitumen. 1 But this complex hydrocarbon is almost solid at room temperature and does not flow without extensive processing. 2 Subsequently there are two ways to extract the bitumen: mining or in situ. 3 Both are complex energy-intensive and expensive processes. 3 As a result oil sands

"Most of the current extraction process takes place in open-pit mines with massive machinery scraping up the tarry sandstone and moving it to facilities for processing. As the name "tar sands" or oil sands implies the heavy crude is found mixed in with sand clay and water which must be removed then the heavy crude must be "upgraded" to reduce viscosity and improve quality.

## What are tar sands? 
Tar sands (also called oil sands) are a mixture of sand clay water and bitumen.[1] Bitumen is a thick sticky black oil that can form naturally in a variety of ways usually when lighter oil is degraded by bacteria.[2] Bitumen has long been used in waterproofing materials for buildings and is most familiar today as the binding agent in road asphalt.
