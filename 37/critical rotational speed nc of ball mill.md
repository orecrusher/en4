## Planetary Mills – fritsch
Planetary Mills are ideally suited for fine grinding of hard medium-hard soft brittle tough and moist materials. The comminution of the material to be ground takes place primarily through the high-energy impact of grinding balls in rotating grinding bowls.

When the critical speed of rotation is significantly exceeded the grinding bodies are pressed to the side of the drum by centrifugal force and grinding ceases.

 · At low rotation speeds the comminution is effected by the balls rolling over the material (cascade motion). At higher speeds some balls are lifted up the wall become detached and drop down onto the material to be milled (aract motion). Above the critical speed centrifugal forces ensure that no more comminution takes place.
