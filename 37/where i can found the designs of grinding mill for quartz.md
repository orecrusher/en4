## Grinding 
Current-conducting grinding wheels are fed with a DC current and an electrolyte is supplied to the cutting zone. Grinding can also be performed by means of vibration machining with an abrasive powder suspended in a liquid. A carborundum abrasive tool is usually used to grind stone. The process may be accomplished by grinders or by hand.
