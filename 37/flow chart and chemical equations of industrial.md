## Rules of Thumb: Flow Parameters 
 · Engineers often discuss rules of thumb for pipe sizing. Velocity (1–4 m/s) and Reynolds number (>10000) are cited as are pressure drop (20-80 kPa/100 m) and shear stress (>5 Pa). Given a flow rate and pipe size these charts give a Reynolds number and velocity. The charts trace any one parameter along with pipe size and yield the remaining

## Methanol Manufacturing Process Using Synthesis Gas 
Methanol is the most flexible chemical commodities and energy sources available today as it can be made from a wide array of feedstocks. Methanol is produced from synthesis gas which has carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen gas as its main components. An important advantage of methanol is that it can be made from any resource that can be converted first into synthesis gas.
