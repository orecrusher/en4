## Ores unprocessed 
Iron ore fines are less desirable (and of lower value) as they need to be sintered before they can be utilised otherwise it will effectively smother the air flow in the blast furnace. The reason lump is preferred is that when it is fed into a blast furnace for steel -making its particle size allows oxygen or air to circulate around the raw materials and melt them efficiently.
