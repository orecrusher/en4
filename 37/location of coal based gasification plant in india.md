Several features of coal gasifiion processes distinguish them from processes based on natural gas naphtha and even heavy fuel oil. Coal is much more variable than any of the other feedstocks and not all gasifiers can handle the whole range of coals. Coal based plants are much more complex and expensive than reforming processes.
