## The Different Types Of Polished Concrete Floors
The Salt and Pepper Polished Concrete Floor: The salt and pepper look requires approximately 1/16-inch surface cut depth and has fine aggregate exposure with little or no medium aggregate exposure in random loions. Depending on the mix of the concrete this type of finish is easily obtained with polished concrete.
