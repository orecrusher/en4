## Steelmaking 
Steelmaking is the process of producing steel from iron ore and/or scrap.In steelmaking impurities such as nitrogen silicon phosphorus sulfur and excess carbon (the most important impurity) are removed from the sourced iron and alloying elements such as manganese nickel chromium carbon and vanadium are added to produce different grades of steel.

## processing processing of low grade iron ore
Removal of Silica and Alumina as Impurities from Low-GradeMagnetic separation and flotation are the two commonly used iron beneficiation processes and selecting the most effective process to treat low-grade ore depends mainly on the mineralogical structure of the ore especially the aggregation of Iron with gangue minerals [5] .

## Steel production environmental impact 
The most common process is the use of a blast furnace to produce pig iron which is about 92-94% iron and 3-5% carbon with smaller amounts of other elements. Pig iron has only limited uses and most of this iron goes on to a steel mill where it is converted into various steel alloys by further reducing the carbon content and adding other elements such as manganese and nickel to give the steel

## Iron and Steel Industry 
 · Iron and steel integrated producers (ore-based) are typically large firms that operate ore and coal mines (frequently as joint ventures) as well as iron and steelmaking plants. Producers include such companies as Essar Steel Algoma (formerly Algoma Steel ) of Sault Ste. Marie Ontario Dofasco of Hamilton Ontario and ArcelorMittal Montréal (formerly Sidbec-Dosco ).

## How Steel is Made Using the Basic Oxygen Steelmaking Process
BOS process usually occurs in large steel processing plants known as steel mills (Steelmaking). (STEEL: From Start to Finish). The iron-ore is ground to a powder and then the ore is separated with strong magnets just at a low temperature.

## Introduction to Iron and Steel 
Iron ore—processed ore at the start of the process has about 65% iron. Impurities (slag) float on the top of melt. Requires about 3.2 tons of raw materials to produce 1.0 ton of steel. 22 Steel production Three types of furnaces have been used for refining pig iron (or scrap steel) to refined steel Open hearth (no longer used the US)

## Steel manufacture 
Iron and steel making by-products. As with all large-scale manufacturing processes the production or iron and steel generates by-products. On average the production of 1 tonne of steel results in 200 kg (EAF) to 400 kg (BF/BOF) of by-products. The main by-products produced during iron and crude steel production are slags (90%) dusts and sludges.

## The Steel Manufacturing Process 
 · The modern-day steel production process began in 1856 under a process known as the Bessemer process. It's largely considered to be the first process used to mass-produce steel. According to historians two different inventors one in the UK and one in Pittsburgh both simultaneously developed a steel production process that involved removing iron's impurities through the use of an air blast.
