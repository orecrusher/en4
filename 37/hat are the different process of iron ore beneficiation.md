Hematite is often cheaper to process than other forms of iron ore as it generally does not require beneficiation due to its higher iron content. However hematite ores may contain higher concentrations of contaminant elements (such as phosphorus alumina and silica) and may therefore need to be blended prior to smelting.

Crude ore or ore mined in the natural state seldom occurs in a pure state and requires some form of beneficiation. Crude ore is commonly mixed with other minerals (gangue) which reduce the iron content.
