 · The famous fire assay has been around for more than 500 years but it still is the best method for determining the quantity of gold in a rock matrix. The fire assay process works by fusing or dissolving the rock sample in a crucible using a lead glass flux. Fluxes of various types are used on various types of ores.

 · The following remarks on the use of the fire assay fluxes and litharge may serve as an aid in arriving to a correct composition of charges for most cases:. Litharge or red lead is added in the proportion of one or two parts to two of ore; if too much litharge (lead oxide) is used the slags are not clean as a slag containing lead may mean a loss of silver and gold.

A gold deposit with a grade equal to 5 g/t (gram per ton) means that in one ton of the ore we have 5 grams of gold.
