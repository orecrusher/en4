## (Bio)chemistry of bacterial leaching—direct vs. indirect 
 · The two different indirect oxidation mechanisms together with the role of the EPS have a fundamental importance for the debate about the "direct" or "indirect" mechanism of bacterial leaching. It becomes evident that a "direct" i.e. enzymatic attack mechanism does not exist.

The indirect mechanism of bacterial leaching which is a combination of these two sub-processes is able to account for the shape of the reaction curve obtained from bacterial leaching experiments. It is also shown that even at very low concentrations of iron in solution the indirect mechanism may be the dominant pathway in bacterial leaching or sulphidic minerals.

Pure pyrite sample was used in the bacterial leaching experiments and was crushed and ground to below 63 micron in the tema mill. Then sample was separated to size fractions by using the Cyclosizer and after 15-20 minutes processing sample from each cyclone were collected into separate beakers filtered dried and weighed.

Bacterial Leaching to precious metals process Process which uses microorganisms for the recovery of precious metals from metal-containing processes and streams. This technology is targeted at using naturally-occurring sulfate-reducing bacteria for the recovery of gold and silver from ores instead of the more traditional — and more toxic — cyanidation process.
