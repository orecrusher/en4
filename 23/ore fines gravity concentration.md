## Underground Preconcentration by Ore Sorting and Coarse 
Ore sorting and coarse gravity concentration are two of the oldest processing methods employed in the mining industry to beneficiate ores. With the rise of fine processing technologies they have suffered a loss in popularity. With the orebodies now being of higher complexity and lower grades coupled

These ultra-fine particles typically make flotation unattractive and we are left with gravity concentration as the only viable option. Gravity Concentration While gravity concentration has historically been confined to the recovery of relatively coarse particles recent innovations in gravity concentration technology has resulted in the ability to recovery finer and finer particles.

Description. Iron Ore (fines) Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in colour from dark grey bright yellow deep purple to rusty red. The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) hematite (Fe 2 O 3) goethite (FeO(OH)) limonite (FeO(OH).n(H 2 O)) or siderite (FeCO 3).

## gravitational seperators for ores
Gravity Concentration. Gravity concentration is the separation of minerals based on differences in specific gravity A gravity concentration process is designed to recover very high grades of valuable ore material into very small mass The resurgence of gravity concentration in mining has come about due to its simplicity and low environmental impact.

Beneficiation of low-grade ore is of critical importance in order to meet the growing demand for coal and mineral industries. But low-grade ores require fine grinding to obtain the desired liberation of valuable minerals. As a result production of fine particles makes the beneficiation process difficult through conventional gravity separators.
