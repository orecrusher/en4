## Circulating Fluidized Bed Combustion 
The CFBC boiler is used in number of units around 250–300 MW in size. In a CFBC unit heat losses from the cyclone(s) are considerable. Thus the thermal efficiency of a CFBC boiler is 3–4% lower than an equivalent-size pulverized coal-fired boiler.

 · In coal fired boilers the ash from the coal itself will be the makeup material. When firing bio fuels with very low ash content sand will be the makeup bed material. For high Sulphur coals Limestone addition to the bed material reduces SO2 emissions. CFBC uses crushed coal of 3 to 6 mm size. This requires only a crusher not a pulverizer.

 · Pulverized coal fired boilers the total losses account to about 12 to 14 %. Roughly 50% of the losses can be tuned to the optimum and the other 50 % is governed by fuel properties like hydrogen in fuel moisture in fuel and ambient air conditions. The main two losses in boiler that can be tuned by operator are carbon loss and dry gas loss.

## What's a good way to use low grade fuels with coal? 
 · The increasing demand for low grade fuels results from a combination of three factors: 1. The long term trend for the price of coal is upwards despite major short-term fluctuations. 2. The reduction in low-cost disposal routes for many waste materials such as coal processing wastes and sewage sludge. 3. Growing interest in the use
