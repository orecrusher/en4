Leaching agent to bring the gold and silver into solution as cyanide complexes and thus separate these metals from the ores. Silver and gold are extracted by the cyanide process (Mac Arthur - Forrest process). After the preliminary crushing and concentration by froth floatation process the ore (crushed auriferous rocks in the case of gold) is

Thus gold is leached to get pure metal. During leaching process gold (Au) is first oxidized by oxygen of the air to Au + ion which then combines with CN-ions to form the soluble complex sodium dicyanoaurate(I). Gold is then extracted from this complex by displacement method by using a more electropositive zinc metal.

 · The new process also can be used to extract gold from consumer electronic waste. Current methods for gold recovery involve the use of highly poisonous cyanides often leading to contamination of the environment. Nearly all gold-mining companies use this toxic gold leaching process to sequester the precious metal.

Thiosulphate leaching is a process that removes gold from gold bearing ores without the use of cyanide. Although not as aggressive a leaching agent as cyanide thiosulphate offers several technological advantages including its lower toxicity and greater efficiency with gold deposits associated with preg-robbing ores. The thiosulphate leaching
