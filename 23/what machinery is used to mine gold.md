They sometimes used mercury which forms an amalgam with small particles of gold and silver. Miners used mechanical crushing and grinding machines to break up ores for further processing. Early miners used Mexican arrastras or stamp mills which reached their peak in the late nineteenth century to crush ores into sand-size particles.

## What Tools Do Miners Use to Find Gold? 
 · Gold prospectors use tools such as gold pans sluice boxes drywashers or highbankers to find gold. Modern prospectors may use metal detectors to help loe likely spots while commercial mining operations use trommels to help crush rocks and separate gold. Gold is heavier than most rock so most gold prospecting tools use gravity to help separate it from the surrounding ore.
