 · What is Iron Smelting? Iron Smelting is the process of making iron ore into iron. The smelters heat up the iron ore to melting point using charcoal as fuel. They then cast the heated iron ore into ingots called pigs. The ingots were either reheated and cast into moulds or they were heated and hammered into wrought iron which is more malleable.

## Method of smelting iron ore 
 · Abstract: A method of smelting iron ore in which iron oxide and hot char are introduced into a primary reactor to reduce the iron oxide and thereby form a molten pool of elemental iron and iron oxide slag. A carbon containing substance comprising fixed carbon and a hydrocarbon containing volatile matter is introduced into a secondary reactor.
