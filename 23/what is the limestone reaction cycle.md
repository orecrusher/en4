## How the Geosphere Rocks Climate 
The Slow Carbon Cycle and Climate. Over millions of years carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas in the atmosphere becomes sequestered in rocks like limestone and fossilized plants that may become coal and other fossil fuels. The carbon is taken out of the faster pattern of carbon cycle processes and is thus sometimes called the slow carbon cycle.

 · Another common reaction is the production of gypsum on the surface of the limestone that comes in contact with sulfuric acid. Gypsum is soluble in water and often does not cling to the surface of a limestone rock; however on buildings or statues that are partially sheltered the gypsum may precipitate and form a crust on the rock.

 · The Bowen reaction series is a description of how magma 's minerals change as they cool. The petrologist Norman Bowen (1887–1956) carried out decades of melting experiments in the early 1900s in support of his theory of granite. He found that as a basaltic melt slowly cooled minerals formed crystals in a definite order.

## Changing pH in Soil 
Consider that limestone moves very slowly taking years to move down a few inches in the soil. This is why it is so important to test soil early in the planning process. Limestone should be tilled into the soil root zone (top 7 inches). Table 1. Approximate Amount of Finely Ground Limestone Needed to Raise the pH of a 7-inch Layer of Soil

## How Is Marble Formed From Limestone? 
 · Marble is formed from limestone when the limestone is affected by heat and high pressure during a process known as metamorphism. During metamorphism the calcite limestone recrystallizes forming the interlocking calcite crystals that make up the marble.

## What Is the Reaction Between Chalk and Vinegar?
 · The reaction between chalk and vinegar is a neutralization reaction between calcium carbonate and acetic acid to produce water carbon dioxide and calcium acetate. Carbon dioxide is a gas that causes the reaction to bubble. The following equation represents the reaction: 2 CH3COOH + CaCO3 = H2O + CO2 + Ca (CH3COO)2.

## How does weathering affect limestone? 
 · Limestone areas are predominantly affected by chemical weathering when rainwater which contains a weak carbonic acid reacts with limestone. This causes the limestone to dissolve. Carbon dioxide from the respiration of animals (and ourselves) is one cause of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Burning fossil fuels also contributes to this.

## Geological Society 
There are different types of chemical weathering the most important are: Solution - removal of rock in solution by acidic rainwater. In particular limestone is weathered by rainwater containing dissolved CO2 (this process is sometimes called carbonation). Hydrolysis - the breakdown of rock by acidic water to produce clay and soluble salts.

## Glaser Coupling Hay Coupling 
Glaser Coupling. Hay Coupling. The Glaser Coupling is a synthesis of symmetric or cyclic bisacetylenes via a coupling reaction of terminal alkynes. Mechanistically the reaction is similar to the Eglinton Reaction; the difference being the use of alytic copper (I) which is reoxidized in the alytic cycle by oxygen in the reaction medium.

## Why Does Vinegar Affect Limestone? 
 · When limestone is introduced to vinegar a chemical reaction occurs. Bubbles will begin rising off the limestone and a little heat will be produced. The vinegar and limestone yield several different compounds after the reaction occurs. There are several reasons why these events happen.

## Reaction between Limestone and SO2 under Conditions 
 · Sulfur capture by limestone under periodically changing oxidizing and reducing conditions was investigated in a quartz reactor. To simulate conditions experienced by limestone particles in fluidized bed combustion short periods of oxidizing and reducing conditions were used. Total cycle times (time under oxidizing conditions + time under reducing conditions) between 2 and 24 s were used.
