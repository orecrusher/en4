## Reasons For Bauxite Beneficiation 
Adopting the process of washing bauxite in the beneficiation plant can reduce caustic soda consumption and equipment and piping scale in the alumina refinery (OPEX) and consequently the payback for the beneficiation plant can be less than 3 (three) years. Besides the caustic consumption reduction the beneficiation plant decreases the refinery

Many bauxite reserves in India have Al2O3/SiO2 ratio of 4 to 6 and hence pose difficulties in production of alumina through the Bayer process. The extraction of alumina from bauxite in low temperature digestion circuit frequently involves a desiliion step in which kaolinite dissolves and reprecipitates as sodalite a caustic insoluble sodium alumino silie.

 · Bauxite is mainly used to extract aluminum. About 85% of bauxite can be refined into alumina and then smelted into aluminum 8% for chemical alumina and 7% for refractory materials proppants and cement. Because of different grades of the ores you can get 2 tons of alumina from 4-6 tons of bauxite and 1ton aluminum from 2 tons of alumina.

Bauxite quality is impacted by the content of alumina and alumina-containing minerals like gibbsite boehmite and diaspor and the amount of reactive silica goethite haematite and other impurities. The wide range in the composition of the different bauxite ores derives from the differences in the origin and geologic history of the individual deposits. In the Bayer plant bauxite mineralogy affects process efficiency by driving the chemical reactions that occur in the process.
