Varying proportions of cement coarse sand (CS) and fine sand (FS) were used in a quest to find an optimum combination for producing CSEB that meet the design criteria outlined in several standards. Inclusion of 50%–60% CS is found to provide maximum density and compressive strength and beyond 60% CS content strength begins to drop.

In the case of 9 inches block the compressive strength is 2.59 N/mm2 and 3.94 N/mm2 for ages 7 days and 28 days respectively. This shows that there is a variation in compressive strength between the two blocks. To this end it can be deduced that the strength of 9 inches block is more and higher than that of the 6 inches block.

## How Does the Ratio of Sand to Cement Affect the Strength 
 · Increasing the Strength. Adjusting the strength of concrete based on the ratio of sand to cement is easy to do. The closer you bring the ratio to an even one-to-one ratio of sand to cement the stronger you will make the concrete. On the other hand if you push the ratio in the other direction you will get a product that has slightly less strength.

## Factors affecting the compressive strength of the concrete 
Concrete strength is of two types; one is compressive strength while the other is the tensile strength of the concrete. The compressive strength is caused due to the material and cement used in concrete structures while the tensile strength is caused partially by concrete itself and a large part of this strength is caused by the reinforced material (steel iron) present in it.

## Compressive strength characteristics of cement stabilized 
 · Rammed earth differs from cement stabilized soil blocks in the method of compaction and construction. Compaction can be given using a steel rammer as shown in Fig. 1.Construction can be carried out with steel slip forms as shown in Fig. 2.In a construction method adopted in Sri Lanka for rapid construction of single storey houses a special vertically sliding formwork system was used.
