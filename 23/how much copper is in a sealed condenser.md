## Copper vs Aluminium Condenser: Why does it matter and what 
Without a condenser your AC would just be a 'fan'. But it's not just the condenser but the material it is made of that affects your AC's performance and cost. Here's a comparison between Copper vs Aluminium condenser so you can identify which suits your needs better.
