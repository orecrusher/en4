## The Extraction of Gold from E
E-waste production in great amounts and its problems which challenge the field of Waste and Environment Management stem from the increase in the production of electronic appliances diversity-seeking consumers and perishable products. To solve the problems and extract valuable metals by hydrometallurgy leaching and organic solvent are used.

Hydrometallurgy is the process of extracting metals from ores by transferring the metal of interest from the ore into an aqueous phase and recovering the metal from the resulting pregnant liquor. Often various hydrometallurgical processes are used in the same flowsheet such as combining ion exchange and solvent extraction for the recovery and purifiion of precious metals.

Gold-selective ion exchange resins have been designed to have a high selectivity for the mono­valent Au (CN) 2- (and Ag (CN) 2- ) species. Any other metals that forms similar complexes such as Cu (CN) 2- will compete for active sites on the resin and reduce the resin's capacity for precious metals.

 · The mythical tale of Jason and the Golden Fleece may have its origins in the placer miners' technique of placing sheep's fleeces in sluices to capture gold flakes. This practice evolved around 1200bc and perhaps marked the start of the development of the 'art' and 'science' involved in recovering gold which existed at low levels in the Earth's crust and even in sea water.

## Hydrometallurgy Gold Extraction 
Hydrometallurgy originated in the 16th century but its principal development took place in the 20th century stimulated partly by the desire to extract gold from low-grade ores. The development of ion exchange solvent extraction and other processes has led to an extremely broad range of appliions of hydrometallurgy now used to produce more than 70 metallic elements.
