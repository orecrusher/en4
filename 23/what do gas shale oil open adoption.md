## Håvard Devold Oil and gas production handbook An 
When new shale gas fields in the US are constrained by the capacity of the existing oil and gas pipeline network it results in bottlenecks and low prices at the production site. Soon oil had replaced most other fuels for motorized transport. The automobile industry developed at the end of the 19th century and quickly adopted oil as fuel.
