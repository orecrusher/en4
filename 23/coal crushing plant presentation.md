## Coal 
Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements chiefly hydrogen sulfur oxygen and nitrogen. Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years.

MCC produces thermal coal for the export market. High ash coal is mined crushed and washed through the Coal Preparation Plant (CPP) while low ash coal is crushed and by-passes the CPP directly to the product stockpile. Coal from Open Cut 1 requires washing by the CPP as a result of dilution associated with mining of the underground roadways.
