Calcium is highly mobile in plants and a consistent supply is needed during fruit set for the fruit to develop properly. Calcium is taken up from the soil through the plants' roots and is transported by the xylem along with water moving up and into the growing points of the plant. This requires an adequate supply of water in the soil.

## Secondary Plant Nutrients: Calcium Magnesium and Sulfur 
Calcium and magnesium both increase soil pH but sulfur from some sources reduces soil pH. Compounds containing one or more of these nutrients are often used as soil amendments rather than strictly as suppliers of plant nutrition. Calcium. The primary function of calcium in plant growth is to provide structural support to cell walls.

## Calcium in biology 
Calcium ions (Ca 2+) contribute to the physiology and biochemistry of organisms' cells.They play an important role in signal transduction pathways where they act as a second messenger in neurotransmitter release from neurons in contraction of all muscle cell types and in fertilization.Many enzymes require calcium ions as a cofactor including several of the coagulation factors.

## Calcium nutrition of higher plants 
the calcium concentration in the soil solution is high compared to other ions (Mengel et al. 1969). This is also reflected in the high losses of calcium by leaching in humid climates. Comparing this high calcium concentration in the soil solution and therefore at the root surface with the requirement of the plants one would think that calcium
