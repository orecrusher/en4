## Calcium Carbonate 
McGrath's Limestone is ideal for the glass industry as it has a high purity with very low levels of undesirables and contaminants that would be detrimental to the glass making process. It has a very low Iron content typically < 0.03% Fe2O3 with high Calcium content in the order of 98.5% CaCO3 and with the added advantage of consistent Magnesium content typically of 1% MgCO3.

## Lime in PCC Manufacturing 
Beginning in the mid to late 1980s a revolution took place as paper manufacturers began switching to an alkaline-based environment. One of the primary advantages to this adjustment was the introduction of precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC). The primary use of PCC is as a filler when making the paper which provides a number of advantages: these advantages include brighter paper better

## Startup Business Opportunities in Hydrated Lime (Calcium 
Lime is a chemical manufactured from calcium carbonate rocks such as limestone (CaCO3) and dolomite (CaCO3MgCO3). Lime can be segregated more specifically into quicklime which is calcium oxide (CaO) or calcium-magnesium oxide (CaMgO) and slaked lime (also called hydrated lime) which is produced by mixing its oxide forms with water.

## Calcium Carbonate Filler 
Limestone is much harder than chalk and very bright limestone deposits are found in such places as Alabama Vermont and British Columbia. Producers of filler-grade calcium carbonate have improved their ability over the years to narrow their particle size ranges and to eliminate large abrasive materials such as quartz sand.

## Lime Production 
Lime Production. In order to purify the beet raw juice SMBSC produces the lime for the manufacture of the calcium hydroxide slurry (milk of lime) and the carbon dioxide gas - both needed for the carbonation process. These two chemicals are produced by calcining (burning) of limestone in vertical kilns using foundry coke as a fuel.
