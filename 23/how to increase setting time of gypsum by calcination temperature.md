The model gypsum can be obtained when the calcination temperature is 190 °C and its fineness and whiteness are higher than that of building gypsum. If raw gypsum is calcined at 400 °C or above 800 °C floor gypsum can be obtained its setting and hardening are slow but the strength wear resistance and water resistance of hardened gypsum are better than that of ordinary building gypsum.
