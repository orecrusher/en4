## Nickel: Extraction and purifiion
 · Nickel is extracted from its ores by conventional roasting and reduction processes which yield a metal of greater than 75% purity. Final purifiion of nickel oxides is performed via the Mond process which increases the nickel concentrate to greater than 99.99% purity.
