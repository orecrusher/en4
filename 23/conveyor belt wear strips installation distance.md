 · When discharging onto a belt conveyor for instance it is sometimes necessary to increase the distance and deliver material at an angle so it picks up speed in the direction of the belt. If the velocity of the material is too low when it hits the belt it will bounce in place until it picks up enough velocity in the direction of the belt travel.
