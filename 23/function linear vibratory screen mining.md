Thus unbalance exciters generate a linear vibratory motion. They are used to drive vibratory conveyors screens and other vibration systems with very high load and/or very high flow rates. It may be noted that working of unbalance exciters is similar to use of two counter-rotating unbalance motors to generate linear vibratory movement.

## Vibratory Screens 
Vibratory Screens. Screening is an important part of processing and is used to separate material according to its size. Material is typically fed to a single- double- or triple-deck screen to make the required sizes. Screens can be considered the cashbox of the operation because while crushers make the gradation screens make the specifiion.
