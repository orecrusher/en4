## Ball Mill: Operating principles components Uses 
 · A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis. The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 – 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.

Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5–10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel. The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle-size measurement device and size-control cyclones.

## Ball Mill Loading 
The starting point for ball mill media and solids charging generally starts as follows: 50% media charge. Assuming 26% void space between spherical balls (non-spherical irregularly shaped and mixed-size media will increase or decrease the free space) 50% x 26% = 13% free space. Add to this another 10%-15% above the ball charge

## Ball Mills 
Ball mills are filled up to 40% with steel balls (with 30–80 mm diameter) which effectively grind the ore. The material that is to be ground fills the voids between the balls. The tumbling balls capture the particles in ball/ball or ball/liner events and load them to the point of fracture.

Investigations were carried out in a laboratory ball mill having the size of DxL = 160x200 mm with a ribbed inside surface of the drum. The mill ball loading was 40% by volume the rotation rate was equal to 85% of the critical speed. Balls were made from steel: S4146 extra high quality having hardness 62 ± 2 HRC according to Rockwell.
