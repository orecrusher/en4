## Aggregate Output Prices and Economic Growth
Aggregate demand and aggregate supply determine the level of real GDP and the price level. The aggregate demand curve is the relationship between real output (GDP) demanded and the price level holding underlying factors constant. Movements along the aggregate demand curve reflect the impact of price on demand.

## What causes an increase in aggregate supply?
 · An increase in aggregate supply due to a decrease in input prices is represented by a shift to the right of the SAS curve. A second factor that causes the aggregate supply curve to shift is economic growth. Positive economic growth results from an increase in productive resources such as labor and capital.

Demand-led growth is the foundation of an economic theory claiming that an increase in aggregate demand will ultimately cause an increase in total output in the long run. This is based on a hypothetical sequence of events where an increase in demand will in effect stimulate an increase in supply (within resource limitations).

Aggregate supply and aggregate demand is the total supply and total demand of all goods and services in an economy. Most nations have economies made up of individual industries and sectors with each one adding to the overall economy. Consumer demand for goods and services affect how companies will meet that demand with products.
