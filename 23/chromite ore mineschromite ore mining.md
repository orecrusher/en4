## Chromite Ore and Mining and Trading Manufacturer 
Although chromite mining in India started around 1903 there was no ferro-chrome production in the country till 1968. Hence most of the chromite ore was exported. India exported about 3.84 million tones in between 1903 to 1980. The current production rate of chromite ore in the country in between 0.7 to 0.9 million tones per annum.

## Chromite 
Chromite is found as orthocumulate lenses of chromitite in peridotite from the Earth's mantle.It also occurs in layered ultramafic intrusive rocks. In addition it is found in metamorphic rocks such as some serpentinites. Ore deposits of chromite form as early magmatic differentiates. It is commonly associated with olivine magnetite serpentine and corundum.
