## The 10 Most Important Vibration Analysis Tips You Need to know
Vibration analysis does not require you to disassemble or stop the machine and therefore it is a non-invasive method. In fact a sensor transforming movement into an electric signal is the principle of a vibration analyzer. Secondary the analyzer calculates all predefined parameters and then stores this signal. Vibration Analysis Sensors

## Vibration Analysis Explained 
 · Vibration analysis is generally broken down into four principles and each principle gives you specific information on the working conditions and features of the vibrating parts. Time domain: When a vibration signal is picked up from a transducer (device that converts a physical quantity into an electrical signal) and displayed on the screen of an oscilloscope it's called a waveform.

## Vibration Motors 
There are two basic types of vibration motor. An eccentric rotating mass vibration motor (ERM) uses a small unbalanced mass on a DC motor when it rotates it creates a force that translates to vibrations. A linear resonant actuator (LRA) contains a small internal mass attached to a spring which creates a force when driven. As specialists in the supply and design of vibration motors you can
