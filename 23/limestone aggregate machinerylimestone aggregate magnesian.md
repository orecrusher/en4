This aggregate is defined by Clause 804 of SHW but in Ireland the relevant clause of SRW is "803" and it is sometimes refered to as a Type A aggregate. There is a wider range of possible sources for a Type 2 than permitted for a compliant Type 1 aggregate - Type 2 may also be sourced from natural sands and/or gravels.

Magnesian Limestone Explained. The Magnesian Limestone is a suite of carbonate rocks in north-east England dating from the Permian period. The outcrop stretches from Nottingham northwards through Yorkshire and into County Durham where it is exposed along the coast between Hartlepool and South Shields. The term has now been discontinued in formal use though it appears widely in popular and

Limestone aggregate and limestone fines accelerated the carbonation reaction in the mortars but the positive impact of limestone aggregates to strength properties of mortars was not observed. Mortars with limestone aggregate showed higher total porosity and water absorption than those with quartz aggregate.
