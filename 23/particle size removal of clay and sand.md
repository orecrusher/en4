sand to improve a clay soil texture needs to be addressed. Soil texture Soil texture is determined by particle size which ranges from microscopic clay flakes to more rounded silt particles to sand grains. While undisturbed sandy soils are well aerated and well drained they are nutrient poor since sand and silt cannot bind mineral nutrients.

## Measuring Soil Texture in the Lab 
Particle size analysis (PSA) determines the relative amounts of sand silt and clay in a soil. These size fractions are the mineral component of a soil and together determine soil texture. PSA is a laboratory alternative to field texturing (see Measuring Soil Texture in the Field fact sheet) and offers a more reliable determination of particle size distribution.

Particle size distribution analysis (PSDA) is a measurement of the size distribution of individual soil/sediment particles sand silt and clay which can be used to understand soil genesis to classify soil or to define texture (Soil Survey Staff 1993). The USDA classifiion of soil texture is based on the proportion of sand 2.0-0.05 mm

Particles become trapped on the surface of or within the medium. The pore size or space between media granules or fibers determines what size particles a filter can remove.
