 · Steel production is a 24-hour-a-day 365-day-a-year process dependent on a consistent supply of raw materials and huge amounts of energy. According to the World Steel Association world crude steel production has increased from 851 million tonnes (Mt) in 2001 to 1606 Mt in 2013 and world average steel use per capita has steadily increased from 150kg in 2001 to 225 kg in 2013.

## The Steel Manufacturing Process 
 · The modern-day steel production process began in 1856 under a process known as the Bessemer process. It's largely considered to be the first process used to mass-produce steel. According to historians two different inventors one in the UK and one in Pittsburgh both simultaneously developed a steel production process that involved removing iron's impurities through the use of an air blast.
