Balancing air pressure in a system with exhaust manifolds thus allowing the use of fewer exhaust fans can be easier than balancing air pressure in buildings with hundreds of exhaust fans. Further the initial equipment installation and operating costs are lower for manifolded exhaust systems than for traditional one-fan-per-fume-hood systems.

Starting at the cylinder head — we don't normally think of the actual exhaust port in the head as a part of the exhaust system — but nonetheless this is where it all begins.
