Sasa is an underground zinc and lead mine that produces approximately 820000 tonnes of ore each year. Accessed by adit the Svinja Reka deposit is currently mined using a sub-level caving method which utilises the geotechnical characteristics of the weak hanging wall to allow the rock to cave naturally into the void remaining after ore has been blasted.

## extraction of metals 
 · Some copper ores can be converted into copper(II) sulphate solution by leaving the crushed ore in contact with dilute sulphuric acid for a long time. Copper can then be extracted from the copper(II) sulphate solution. But in many cases it is possible to separate the metal compound from unwanted rocky material by physical means.
