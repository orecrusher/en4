## Depleted Uranium 
Depleted Uranium In recent years nuclear power has been getting a second look. The increased attention in nuclear energy has been stimulated of late through changes in governmental policy (i.e. loan guarantees) public opinion on global warming concerns over foreign oil dependence and industrial investment opportunities.

URANIUM MINES Most uranium ore is mined in open pit or underground mines. The uranium content of the ore is often between only 0.1% and 0.2%. Therefore large amounts of ore have to be mined to get at the uranium. In the early years up until the 1960's uranium was predominantly mined in open pit mines from ore deposits loed near the surface.
