 · Side Milling. The side milling is the production of a flat vertical surface on the side of a work piece by using a side-milling cutter. The depth of cut is adjusted by rotating the vertical feed screw of the table. Straddle Milling. When two or more parallel vertical surfaces are machined at a single cut the operation is called straddle milling.

Vertical Machining also known as milling relies on rotary cutters to remove metal from a workpiece. Vertical machining occurs on a vertical machining center (VMC) which employs a spindle with a vertical orientation. With a vertically oriented spindle tools stick straight down from the tool holder and often cut across the top of a workpiece.
