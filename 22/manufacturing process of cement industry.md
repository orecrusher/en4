how cement and concrete are made. Cement is the essential ingredient in concrete. It is a fine powder that acts as the glue that holds concrete together when mixed with water sand and aggregates. Cement is manufactured by heating a precise mixture of finely ground limestone clay and sand in a rotating kiln to temperatures reaching 1450ºC.
