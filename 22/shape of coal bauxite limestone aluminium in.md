Bauxite is a result of intense leaching in a hot and humid climate with alternating wet and dry seasons and good downward drainage. The climate promotes vegetation that provides organic acids which help to dissolve rocks in percolating water that carries more soluble components away leaving only aluminum and also often iron as the least mobile common ions behind.

## Bauxite: The principal ore of aluminum. 
Bauxite is the primary ore of aluminum. Almost all of the aluminum that has ever been produced has been extracted from bauxite. The United States has a few small bauxite deposits but at least 99% of the bauxite used in the United States is imported. The United States is also a major importer of aluminum
