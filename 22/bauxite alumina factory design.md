## Chapter 2. Production and Processing of Aluminum
Fig. 2.2 shows that the production of alumina is a complex chemical process. The alu-mina content of bauxite ores varies from one deposit to another and methods of treat-ment differ accordingly (see 16.1.2). This means that each alumina plant is almost tailor-made to suit a particular bauxite. The processes are nevertheless basically similar

## Aluminium for Future Generations – Raw Materials
Bauxite consumption per tonne of alumina has increased in recent years (up from around 2750 in 2005) due to declining quality of bauxite resources. However the energy efficiency of the Bayer process has improved over that period indiing that the industry is developing innovative technologies to extract alumina from bauxite in increasingly cost-effective ways.
