## Summary of Mercury Amalgamation Gold Extraction Process
 · The principle of gold extraction by using mercury (amalgamation method) is mainly that after the mercury is added to the slurry the surface of the gold particles is wetted by mercury and then the mercury diffuses into the interior of the gold particles causing a chemical reaction. Au+2Hg=AuHg2. Finally the solid of Au3 Hg will form.
