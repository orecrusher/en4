## Silica 
Silica. Also called silica sand or quartz sand silica is silicon dioxide (SiO 2). Silicon compounds are the most significant component of the Earth's crust. Since sand is plentiful easy to mine and relatively easy to process it is the primary ore source of silicon. The metamorphic rock quartzite is another source.
