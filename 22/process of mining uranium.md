## Uranium Mining and Milling Wastes: An Introduction
URANIUM MINES Most uranium ore is mined in open pit or underground mines. The uranium content of the ore is often between only 0.1% and 0.2%. Therefore large amounts of ore have to be mined to get at the uranium. In the early years up until the 1960's uranium was predominantly mined in open pit mines from ore deposits loed near the surface.

At the mill uranium ore undergoes a variety of changes to turn it into a finished product: uranium powder also known as yellowcake.. The milling process is so important that the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission has helped mines establish mills close by to make it easier to process uranium ore and quicken the production of yellowcake [source: Amundson].
