 · The cost per ton of ore mined is important but may be overemphasized if the more important cost that per unit of metal recovered is thereby overlooked. A given stoping method may give a low cost per ton of ore but by reason of high dilution involving the handling hauling hoisting and treating of a large amount of barren rock may result in a high cost per unit of metal.
