## An eccentric solution to the primary crushing concept 
 · Consequently the crushing gap between the crusher roll and the jaw in the crusher housing changes continuously which means the feed material is crushed by compressive forces as it falls by gravity until the product exits the crushing chamber at the bottom. The eccentric shaft is driven by a V-belt drive with the inertia of two flywheels
