## Rolling (metalworking) 
Hot rolling is a metalworking process that occurs above the recrystallization temperature of the material. After the grains deform during processing they recrystallize which maintains an equiaxed microstructure and prevents the metal from work hardening.The starting material is usually large pieces of metal like semi-finished casting products such as slabs blooms and billets.
