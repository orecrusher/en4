## What is Coal Washing? 
 · Coal washing is a process that is undertaken in a coal washery or coal preparation plant (CPP) where coal is refined or cleaned of impurities. Coal washing involves using water mechanical techniques and relies on gravity and the difference of density between coal and it's impurities which are usually more densely packed due to the fact that they are inorganic.

## What is clean coal technology? 
Some clean coal technologies purify the coal before it burns. One type of coal preparation coal washing removes unwanted minerals by mixing crushed coal with a liquid and allowing the impurities to separate and settle. Other systems control the coal burn to minimize emissions of sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and particulates.

 · Further washes are required to free the coal completely of chloride; these go to waste. Some 320 liter of liquor is withdrawn from the separating tank by each metric ton of raw coal. The specific gravity of the liquor is dropped from 1.4 to about 1.2 by the wash water and the inherent moisture of the coal.
