Ore is processed using conventional techniques and differential flotation. Ore is passed to the primary crusher and crushed to 150mm. This is passed to the secondary and tertiary crushers and ground to 16mm. After milling the ore is fed into the flotation circuit. Following differential flotation zinc lead and copper concentrates are produced.
