## Forest
The study recognises the diversity of impacts associated with both Large-scale Mining (LSM) and Artisanal and Small-scale Mining (ASM) – the impacts of the latter being largely understudied. Two studies were therefore undertaken in order to draw lessons on 'forest-smart mining': LSM in forest landscapes; ASM in forest landscapes.

## Small Scale Mining 
 · Small Scale Mining. ASM refers to the "low-tech labour intensive mineral extraction and processing found across the developing world" (Hilson and McQuilken 2014) encompassing varying degrees of formality and legality characterised by "low levels of environmental health and safety awareness" (Hilson 2002: 4) and usually loed in remote rural areas (Hilson 2002).

## Small Scale Mining from the Perspective of Disabled Miners
"This project is based on a case study of the lives of people in Mongolia who have a disability as a result of working as a small scale miner (with a focus on artisanal and ninja miners). The research for this project was conducted after the culmination of a four month study abroad experience in Mongolia in Spring 2017. It was carried out over a four week period in Ulaanbaatar Bayankhongor

## Injury rate and risk factors among small
 · Aside from the above few studies little is known about injury rates or risk factors in small-scale gold mining in Ghana. Therefore this study was initiated to estimate the injury rate among small-scale (" galamsey" ) gold miners to determine the risk factors for injury and to examine the safety perceptions and PPE use among these workers.
