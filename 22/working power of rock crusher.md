## What is the eccentric throw? — SRP 
The eccentric throw is one of the most important parameters in defining the job that your cone crusher does. The mantle in a cone crusher spins in conical pendulum motion. That means it doesn't stay in the center of the chamber – it sweeps around moving closer and further away from the concave. This is what creates the crushing action.

## Clearing Blocked Crushers 
Crushing is the first step in converting rock into usable products. Essentially crushing is no more than taking large rocks and reducing them to small pieces. Crushing is sometimes continued until only fines remain. Blockage incidents can be greatly reduced by supplying rock that is properly sized to match the primary jaw opening.
