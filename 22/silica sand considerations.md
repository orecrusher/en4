## Silica Nanoparticles for Increased Cosmetic Ingredient 
 · Silica can be divided into the main two classes: crystalline and amorphous. Crystalline micron-sized silica is a basic component of soil sand granite and many other minerals; amorphous silica is synthetic except for biogenic diatomaceous earth which is composed of particles or structural units less than 1 μm in diameter.

Geochemists also use the term "silica" to refer to the overall silicon and oxygen content of rocks. This is confusing but stems from the fact that in rock analysis and sample is dissolved the solution treated and the amount of silicon present is determined by precipitating it as silica. So a geologist may say "This rock is 48% silica".

The use of glass as filtration media began in the late 1990s and is gaining popularity as an alternative to sand and silica. Glass came naturally as filtration media as a result of the unceasing search for the best media. This is because it offers superior performance and it is in generous supply in the form of broken pieces of glass from a waste/recycling stream and thus is very cost effective.

Silica in the Ocean. Dissolved silica in the ocean largely takes the form of silicic acid Si(OH) 4.Since it is acidic and has a pKa somewhat above normal seawater pH values (pKa ~ 9.5 in freshwater; possibly it is a bit lower in seawater) about 5% of it will be present as silie Si(OH) 3 O –.Apparently many diatoms take up the Si(OH) 4 form directly although there is some evidence
