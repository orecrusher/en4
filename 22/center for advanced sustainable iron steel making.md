## High Carbon Steel 
High carbon steels as their name suggests are steels with high carbon content. If iron is heated to a high temperature it dissolves carbon which would normally precipitate upon cooling. However if this liquid metal is cooled very quickly by 'quenching' it in water the carbon is trapped and distorts the structure of the substance forming high carbon steel.
