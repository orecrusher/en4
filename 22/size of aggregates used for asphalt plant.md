## Hot Mix Asphalt For Sale 
Typical asphalt mixes are composed of 5% asphalt cement and 95% aggregates (stone sand and gravel). Due to its highly viscous nature asphalt must be heated so it can be mixed with the aggregates at the asphalt mixing facility. The durability and flexibility of the asphalt can be altered by increasing or decreasing the size of the aggregate.
