Early civilizations were built with bricks from their roads to their buildings such as Ur (4000 B.C.) in what is now Iraq. Bricks are a simple and sturdy building material--they're heat and water resistant easy to install and need very little upkeep. You can make your own red construction bricks creating your project from beginning to end.

Bricks should contain a little amount of finely powdered lime. It enables silica (of a required portion) to melt at the furnace temperature of 1650 o C and binds the particles of brick together resulting in strong and durable bricks. At about 1100 o C lime acts as a alyst to elevate the furnace temperature to 1650 o C at which silica fuses.

 · The oldest known bricks date back to 7500 BC. Presently concrete sand and lime and glass with clay are being used to make bricks. The color and hardness of the brick is determined by the raw materials used and the baking temperature. Most bricklaying is done manually hence the brick size is maintained at a size comfortable to fit in the hand.
