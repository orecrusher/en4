ES396183A1 Process for preparing nitrogen monoxide. A process for the production of nitrogen monoxide by contacting ammonia and molecular oxygen at an elevated temperature in a reaction zone in the presence of a alytic system containing CO3O4 characterized by the step of intermittently reducing or interrupting the supply of ammonia to the reaction.

## Reactor For Manufacture Of Nitrogen Monoxide
reactor for manufacture of nitrogen monoxide. Carbon monoxide | CO - PubChem. Carbon monoxide reacts with water vapour at high temperatures forming carbon dioxide and hydrogen; this process has been used as a source of hydrogen for combination with nitrogen in the synthesis of ammonia.With caustic alkalies carbon monoxide forms alkali formates which can be converted into
