## Uranium Mining and Extraction from Ore 
These processes are very similar to bulk mining techniques employed for other materials. The raw material which is U 3 O 8 must also be analyzed with a beta-gamma detecting instruments to ensure proper levels of uranium content. [24] Most of the chemistry of the uranium mining process occurs after the ore has been isolated.

 · Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining. The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however because iron does not occur naturally it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.
