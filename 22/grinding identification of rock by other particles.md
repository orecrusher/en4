 · Graf (1991) concluded that the range number and dimension of fractal elements in a fine particle depend not only on the geometry of the particle but also on the resolution limits (step lengths) of the investigator. He listed four recommendations to remedy the problem of scale sensitivity: 1. Scales of Richardson diagrams must be made by using both the absolute and Feret-normalized measures.
