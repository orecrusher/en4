 · A higher Hardgrove index indies the coal is easier to grind. 50 HGI normally is taken for calculating the base capacity of the mill. When coal with HGI higher than 50 is fed to the pulverizer the output will be higher than base capacity and below 50 HGI the output will be lower. The total moisture in coal has a high effect on mill output.

## Exploring ball size distribution in coal grinding mills 
Tube mills use steel balls as grinding media. Due to wear in the abrasive environment it is necessary to charge new balls periodically to maintain a steady balanced ball charge in the mill. The amount and ball size distribution in this charge as well as the frequency with which new balls are added to the mill have significant effects on the mill capacity and the milling efficiency.
