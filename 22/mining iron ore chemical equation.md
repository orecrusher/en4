 · Fig 1 A typical open pit iron ore mine. On the basis of mining methods iron ore mining can be broadly divided into two egories namely manual mining and mechanized mining. Large iron ore mines are mechanized mines while manual mining methods are employed in the small mines. Manual mining method is normally limited to float ores.

Iron(III)oxide has the formula Fe 3 O 4 and is known in the mining world as magnetite. It is one of the the primary compounds in the ore that is mined so that we can produce iron and more importantly - steel. So here is the question: how many kilograms of iron can be produced from 1.25 metric tons of iron ore in the form of magnetite?

Iron ore is the raw material used to make pig iron which is one of the main raw materials to make steel. Raw iron is alloyed with a variety of elements (such as tungsten manganese nickel vanadium chromium) to strengthen and harden it making useful steel for construction automobiles and other forms of transportation such as trucks trains and train tracks.

## Iron Ore 
Mining iron ore or other iron-bearing materials from the ground is the first step to make iron and steel. Iron ores are rocks from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. These rocks are usually found in the form of hematite (Fe 2 O 3) or magnetite (Fe 3 O 4). Common types of iron ores and their iron contents are shown in Table 2.1.

Ores are often oxides carbonates or sulphides because these non-metals readily combine with many metals. e.g. iron + oxygen ===> iron oxide ores. Fe + O 2 (air) ===> Fe 2 O 3 or Fe 3 O 4 (not balanced equations just the idea!) This the typical chemistry involved in metal ore formation.
