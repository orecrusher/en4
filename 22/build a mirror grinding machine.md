Grinding On the picture below the machine is fine grinding an 8 inch mirror with an 71% tool (143 mm diameter) and 9 micron aluminium oxyde. The bent lines on the mirror are the effect of the tool turning - with respect to the mirror - faster at the central part of the mirror as compared to the edge zones.

The mirror or lens grinding machine is a masterpiece of mechanical engineering. It has several gears in mesh at all times and also has several variable settings built into it. This machine was most likely designed by Leonardo while he was either investigating the different ways that light reflected off things or maybe he was planning on inventing a telescope or some other optical device.

With the Mirror on top the tool on the bottom and coarse grit in between we start grinding with the mirror overhanging the tool. We rub the center of mirror against the edge of the tool and this wears a depression in the center of the mirror (the edge of the tool wears down also so that the tool becomes convex (a "hill" in the center) and the mirror becomes concave (a shallow "bowl").

Make a polishing tool from plaster like we did for fine grinding of at least 1/2 the mirror diameter. Let it dry thoroughly and seal with water sealer or something similar. By using a tool of this size we avoid astigmatism and produce a zone free surface absent of roughness so typical of small tools.
