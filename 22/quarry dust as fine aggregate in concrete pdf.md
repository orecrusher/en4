## STUDY OF PARTIAL REPLACEMENT OF FINE AGGREGATE BY U 
Quarry dust can be an economic alternative to the river sand. It is a waste obtained during quarrying process. It has very rece ntly gained good attention to be used as an effective fi ller material instead of fine aggregate. In the present study the hardened and durable properties of concrete using quarry dust were investigated. Figure 4.
