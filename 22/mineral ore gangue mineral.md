Gangue minerals can often have severe adverse effects on selective value mineral separation. Such effects can be mediated through a variety of pathways or mechanisms. One popular mechanism is that of "slime coating" or heterocoagulation wherein the gangue mineral fines are believed to coat the value mineral surfaces and thereby reduce selectivity and floatability.
