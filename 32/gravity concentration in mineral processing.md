## gravity concentration in mineral processing
Mineral processing can involve four general types of unit operation: comminution particle size reduction; sizing separation of particle sizes by screening or classifiion; concentration by taking advantage of physical and surface chemical properties; and dewatering solid/liquid separation In all of these processes the most important considerations are the economics of the processes and this

## Minerals 
Worldwide there are over 43 million artisanal miners in virtually all developing countries extracting at least 30 different minerals. Gold due to its increasing value is the main mineral extracted by at least half of these miners. The large majority use amalgamation either as the final process to extract gold from gravity concentrates or from the whole ore.

## Gravity Concentration Mineral Processing
Gold Gravity Concentration Mineral Processing Metallurgy. The object of gravity concentration is the separation of the heavy valuable mineral from the light worthless gangue. Compliions are often introduced by the fact that various base minerals must be separated from one another an ore being subdivided into several products.
