Increasing the flow rate makes the flow more turbulent and increases the value of k. Throttling the flow makes it less turbulent and reduces the value of k. It is therefore normally desirable to avoid variations in the flow rate through a heat exchanger but for economic reasons it might be necessary to accept some variations in certain types of production.
