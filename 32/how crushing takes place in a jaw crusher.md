Jaw crushers are mainly used as primary crushers to produce material that can be transported by belt conveyors to the next crushing stages. The crushing process takes place between a fixed jaw and a moving jaw. The moving jaw dies are mounted on a pitman that has a reciproing motion. The jaw dies must be replaced regularly due to wear.

## Crushers 
The main purpose of a primary crusher is to reduce the material to a size that allows its transportation on a conveyor belt. In most crushing installations a jaw crusher takes care of primary crushing. Plants with very high capacities that are common in mining and less popular in aggregates production normally use a primary gyratory crusher.

Jaw crushers operate according to the principle of pressure crushing. The crushed material is crushed in the wedge-shaped pit between the fixed crusher jaw and the crusher jaw articulated on an eccentric shaft. The material is crushed by the elliptic course of movement and falls down due to gravity.
