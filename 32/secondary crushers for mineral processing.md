## Crusher 
A. Gupta D.S. Yan in Mineral Processing Design and Operation 2006 6.1.3 Roll Crusher Circuit Design. Roll crushers are generally not used as primary crushers for hard ores. Even for softer ores like chalcocite and chalcopyrite they have been used as secondary crushers. Choke feeding is not advisable as it tends to produce particles of irregular size.

## Crushing 
Crushing. Crushing is often one of the first steps in the production of rock coal and other minerals as mined material can consist of boulders that are too big to fit through the processing plant. The type of crusher required depends on the material being reduced. McLanahan specializes in a variety of crushing solutions for reducing minerals

Thus the future technology used in metallic mineral processing is subject to change. Conceivably mixed processes will see increased use. In these systems primary crushing (and perhaps secondary crushing) would be dry operations. Subsequent size-reduction operations would be wet but would not be designed to reduce all the ore to the desired size.
