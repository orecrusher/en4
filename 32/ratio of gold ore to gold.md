The gold adsorbs onto the surface of the carbon. The loaded carbon is periodically removed from the columns and sent to the stripping circuit. The carbon is then generally subjected to a heated solution (200 deg to 250 deg F) of (1%) sodium hydroxide and (0.1%) cyanide and the gold is re-dissolved and removed from the carbon surface.

## Extraction of gold using cyanide 
Extraction of gold using cyanide Gold is found in very low concentrations in the ore from which it is mined. To collect the gold from the ore it needs to be separated from the other minerals in the ore. To do this the gold needs to be made into a soluble form so that it can be separated from the other minerals as gold is insoluble.

## Extraction of Gold from a Low
The treatment process of a low-grade refractory gold ore containing sulfide minerals and carbonaceous matters was studied in this work. The gold extraction of this ore by all-s cyanidation was only 11.75%. Hence a pretreatment was necessary. In this paper a flotation-preoxidation-cyanide leaching process was developed.

These ores consist of shales and "dirty" limestones containing very fine (submicroscopic) gold. Oxidized ores leach very well with low reagent consumption and production recovery of 80% or better. Ores are typically coarse-crushed (75mm) but may show recovery of 70% or better at run-of-mine sizes.
