How Impact Crushers Work Impact Crushers create material reduction by providing a sudden impact force that causes the material to shatter along all the weakest fissures in the stone. Controlling the flow of the material through the Impact Crusher requires features that vary from one style of impactor to another and this is what separates McLanahan from the other manufacturers.
