## Firearms History Technology Development: Hammer Fired 
 · In the world of modern firearms which use centerfire cartridges there are two major types of mechanisms used to trigger the cartridge primer.One uses a hammer and another uses a striker. Therefore mechanisms that use a hammer are called hammer-fired and the ones that use a striker are called striker fired.As you can guess each mechanism has its own group of supporters.

A stamp mill consists of a set of heavy steel (iron-shod wood in some cases) stamps loosely held vertically in a frame in which the stamps can slide up and down. They are lifted by cams on a horizontal rotating shaft.As the cam moves from under the stamp the stamp falls onto the ore below crushing the rock and the lifting process is repeated at the next pass of the cam.

## The operating principle of the ball mill
 · Therefore the work of the mill with partial load conditions is unprofitable. Energy consumption for ball mills is a function of many factors: the physical properties of the ground material – its specific gravity and hardness; the degree of drum filling by grinding balls; the number of drum rotations etc. Ball mills have low efficiency – no more than 15%.

The Operating Principal. P ulverization takes place in the central chamber of the Micron-Master® jet energy mill as the process material is driven at near sonic velocity around the perimeter of the toroidal chamber by multiple jets of air or steam. No grinding media is involved. Size reduction is the result of the high-velocity collisions between particles of the process material itself.
