## Architectural Acoustics 
Decibels [dB]: The decibel is used in acoustics as the standard unit of sound pressure level or the loudness of a sound. Keep in mind that sound pressure increases on a logarithmic scale. As a general rule of thumb an increase of 10 dB means the sound is perceived to be twice as loud – however this can vary based on the type of sound and the listening conditions.

## What are decibels the decibel scale noise measurement 
 · Because sound pressure levels in decibels (dB) use a logarithmic scale we can't just add two dB readings together. For instance in a factory if one machine's noise level is measured at 90 dB(A) and then we start up a second machine also measuring 90 dB(A) the resulting noise is not 180 dB(A) instead because we know that 3dB represents a doubling of the noise 90dB + 90dB = 93dB.

 · For example the 2005 Regulations require employers to take action to protect workers at levels of noise 5 dB(A) lower than in the 1989 Regulations and require health surveillance (hearing checks) for workers regularly exposed above 85 dB(A). Many thousands of people are exposed to loud noise at work that may be a risk to their hearing.

(We do not know the specifiions of your equipment of course and we don't know how high you have set the 'volume' knob.)
