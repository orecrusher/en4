 · In heap leaching highly oxidized ores the decomposition of cyanide by carbon dioxide may be as great as that caused by the acid constituents of the ore. The decomposition of cyanide by carbon dioxide as well as by ground acids is minimized by using sufficient alkali such as lime (CaO) or caustic soda (NaOH) in the leach solution to maintain the alkalinity at a pH range of 9 to 11.
