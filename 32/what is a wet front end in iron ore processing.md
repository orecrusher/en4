## Experimental 
Data processing. Moles of manganate(VII) = 0.01 x 0.01 = 0.0001 mol. Therefore from the reaction stoichiometry moles of iron(II) = 5 x 0.0001 = 5.00 x 10-4 mol. This is in 27.90 ml therefore in 250 ml there is (250/27.9) x 5.00 x 10-4 = 8.96 x 5 x 10-4 moles of iron = 4.48 x 10-3 mol. Therefore mass of iron in 250 ml = 56 x 4.48 x 10-3 g = 0.25 g. Hence mass of iron per tablet = 250 mg

## Extraction of Resources 
Processing of ore from a lode mine whether it is a surface or subsurface mine requires that the rock ore be crushed and pulverized before extraction of the valuable minerals begins. After lode ore is crushed recovery of the valuable minerals is done by one or a combination of several mechanical and chemical techniques.

Iron is essential for nitrogen binding and nitrate reduction and it may be a limiting factor for phytoplankton growth. Solubility in salt water is extremely low. The iron cycle means reduction of tertiary iron by organic ligands (a process that is photo alysed in surface waters) and oxidation of binary iron.
