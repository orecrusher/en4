## Product Brochure Rotor Weighfeeder Pfister DRW
The coal is extracted out of a coal silo (1) supported by an aeration system (2). The rotor weighfeeder Pfister® DRW (4) doses the coal with high precision and the transport air (5) discharges the machine and blows the coal directly to the burner. The high feed accuracy of the rotor weighfeeder ensures a steady air/coal mixture for the burner.

Coal from the boiler bunkers is fed under control into the mills the feed rate being determined by the requirements for steam. Inside the mills either large steel balls or rollers run in circular tracks to pulverise the coal to powder. This fine highly combustible powder is blown from each mill into the boilers at some 63 tons an hour.
