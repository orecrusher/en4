## Coal in the cement industry
The selection of coal for cement industry should be judiciously done. The temperature vis-à-vis heat required in the rotary kiln depends on the composition of raw feed. Hence the coal should be selected in such a way that it should be able to generate requisite gross calorific value. In direct firing system high moisture coal is not suitable. The presence of chlorine or sulphur in coal is never favourable.

## Poland: coal ash is greening cement! 
 · Industry Materials Reuse. EKO-ZEC Veolia's Polish subsidiary recovers fly ash from coal combustion for use in cement production. Since the beginning of 2017 some of the surplus has been exported to other European countries. In the end it means improvement quality parameters of cement and therefore stronger and greener concrete structures.

## Global decrease in coal burning leads to stalling of CO2 
In 2015 after three years of slow growth the growth of global CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel use and from steel and cement production was brought to a standstill. One of the main causes was the 2% global decrease in coal burning and cement production - the largest decrease over the past five decades apart from recessions. The global decrease in CO2 emissions from coal use
