 · Although all rare earth minerals are generally open-pit mined the energy requirement for crushing and grinding varies depending on their hardness and the gangue minerals associated. The physical and chemical beneficiation of bastnäsite is different from that of monazite and xenotime as bastnäsite is a carbonate-fluoride mineral and monazite and xenotime are both phosphate minerals.

It implies that the specific energy required to crush a material for example from 10 cm down to 5 cm is the same as the energy required to crush the same material from 5 mm to 2.5 mm. Rittinger on the other hand assumed that the energy required for size reduction is directly proportional not to the change in length dimensions but to the change in surface area.
