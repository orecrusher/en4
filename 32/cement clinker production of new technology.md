## What is Cement Clinker? Composition Types Uses 
Clinker is a nodular material produced in the kilning stage during the production of cement and is used as the binder in many cement products. The lumps or nodules of clinker are usually of diameter 3-25 mm and dark grey in color. It is produced by heating limestone and clay to the point of liquefaction at about 1400°C-1500°C in the rotary kiln.

## cement clinker production of new technology
The technology developed by thyssenkrupp lowers CO2 emissions in cement production by up to 40 percent. It involves replacing part of the cement clinker with calcined i.e. thermally activated clay. Cimpor Global Holdings will use the technology known as "polysius activated clay" on an industrial scale at a new plant being built near the Cameroon sea port of Kribi.

Cement production is responsible for more than 8% of global CO 2 emissions. It is accountable for a total of 2.2 billion tons of which 90% are generated during clinker production. In order to comply with the provisions of the Paris Agreement the cement industry would have to reduce its emissions by at least 16% by the year 2030.
