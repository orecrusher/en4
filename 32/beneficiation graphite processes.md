Graphite (/ ˈ ɡ r æ f ˌ aɪ t /) archaically referred to as plumbago is a crystalline form of the element carbon with its atoms arranged in a hexagonal structure.It occurs naturally in this form and is the most stable form of carbon under standard conditions.Under high pressures and temperatures it converts to diamond.Graphite is used in pencils and lubricants.

## Beneficiation 
In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals which results in a higher grade product (ore concentrate) and a waste stream ().There are many different types of beneficiation with each step furthering the concentration of the original ore.

 · In beneficiation of graphite by the method of flotation it has been almost impossible to avoid the entrainment of gangues such as sericite into graphite concentrate. Hence to solve the aforementioned problem the use of Nigrosin (C 22 H 16 N 6 O 3) as a depressant for graphite in lead-zinc ore processing technology was introduced recently .
