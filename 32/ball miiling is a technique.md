## A Review of Methods for Synthesis of Al Nanoparticles 
The objective of milling is to reduce the particle size and blending of particles in new phases. The different type of ball milling can be used for synthesis of nanomaterials in which balls impact upon the powder charge [12]. High-energy ball milling is a convenient way to produce nanosized powders.
