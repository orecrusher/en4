## Everything About Mortar In Construction 
Mortar normally includes one of 3 types of cementitious material: Portland cement and lime mortar cement or masonry cement. A better understanding of how water aggregate and cementitious materials affect the properties and field performance of the mortar helps in assuring that building structures are well-designed water-resistant and attractive.

## Brick masonry and unit consumption of cement 
 · Brick masonry unit Cement consumption. In brick work a question arise in mind how much cement required to do one cubic meter brick work. Now according to code the rate of consumption of cement is 0.21. That means 21% of one bag of cement. One bag cement weight is 50 kg that means 21% of 50 kg is equal to 10.5 kg cement.
