## Fire protection for power plants (NFPA 850) 
NFPA 850 provides recommendations (not requirements) for fire protection for fossil fueled (i.e. coal gas or oil) or alternative fueled (i.e. biomass solid waste etc) power generation plants.. Nuclear power plants or hydroelectric power plants are not covered by NFPA 850: Nuclear power plants standards are addressed by NFPA 805 whereas recommendations for hydroelectric power plants are

## Coal
 · A coal-fired power station is an energy plant that burns coal – a fossil fuel – to generate electricity that's fed into the grid which supplies power to homes and businesses. There are a few key energies stored in coal and when successfully converted can create thermal energy mechanical energy and electrical energy.

## 1. CLASSIFICATION OF INSTRUMENTS IN POWER PLANT
 · Power plants burning coal fuel oil or natural gas are often called fossil-fuel power plants. Some biomass-fueled thermal power plants have appeared also. Non-nuclear thermal power plants particularly fossil-fueled plants which do not use co-generation are sometimes referred to as conventional power plants.

This raises the possibility that power plant developers will continue to follow the pattern of the 1990s and rely heavily on natural gas plants to meet the need for new power generation.! With current technology coal-fired power plants using carbon capture equipment are an expensive source of electricity in a carbon control case.
