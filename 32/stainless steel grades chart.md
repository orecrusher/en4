Martensitic stainless steels: Basic corrosion resistant grades (Cr~13%) the higher carbon content compare to ferritic allow them to be hardened by heat treatment while still being fairly weldable. Precipitation hardening stainless steels: The addition of aluminum copper or aluminium in these chromium-nickel grades allow them to be hardened by a solution and aging heat treatment.

 · "Stainless steel grades" is the way in which we egorize the mechanical properties and production specifi­ions as well as the composition of stainless steel. There is an old three digit number system which is still used for the classi­fica­tion of grades but over time new classi­fica­tion systems have been developed.
