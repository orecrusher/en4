## Conventional Coal
A conventional coal-fired power plant with post-combustion capture has to separate carbon dioxide from a flue gas mixture in which there is a large amount of nitrogen. The oxyfuel process by removing the nitrogen at the start so that coal burns in oxygen instead of air sidesteps this problem because the flue gases from the combustion process are largely carbon dioxide. This makes is much easier to isolate.

 · Coal Power Plant Schematic Diagram. 8:12 AM. Posted by Energetic. Generation of electricity in a coal-fired steam station is similar to a nuclear station. The difference is the source of heat. The burning of coal replaces fissioning or splitting of uranium atoms as the source of heat. The heat turns water to steam in steam generators.
