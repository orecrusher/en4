## Capturing The Wind: How Wind Energy Is Harnessed 
How Wind Energy Is Distributed. The energy that is harnessed from the wind has the ability to provide energy to anything from a single home or farm to entire neighborhoods including homes schools and businesses. Basically wind energy can be used for anything that is powered by other more traditional methods of electricity.

## Wind Energy Facts and Calculation
Particularly in wind turbines the energy is extracted from the air as it moves through the "swept area" of the turbine's blades. During this process the air turns the aerodynamically designed blades which transfer this harvested energy into a spinning shaft. The shaft is connected to a generator's rotor whose motion makes electricity.

## How Do Wind Turbines Work? 
 · A wind turbine turns wind energy into electricity using the aerodynamic force from the rotor blades which work like an airplane wing or helicopter rotor blade. When wind flows across the blade the air pressure on one side of the blade decreases. The difference in air pressure across the two sides of the blade creates both lift and drag.

A windmill is a big structure also called a mechanical device that transforms wind energy into electrical energy. It is a big structure that contains sails mounted on a rotating shaft.; these rotating sails help transform wind's kinetic energy into electricity.. These sails make an angle so that when they rotate the force of the wind against them is divided into the two following components:

## How is energy converted in a windmill? – Mvorganizing
How is energy converted in a windmill? A wind turbine transforms the mechanical energy of wind into electrical energy. A turbine takes the kinetic energy of a moving fluid air in this case and converts it to a rotary motion. As wind moves past the blades of a wind turbine it moves or rotates the blades. These blades turn a generator.

Research by the USDepartment of Energy (DOE) in the 1970s focused on large turbine designs with funding going to major aerospace manufacturers.

## 100% renewable and eco
 · Electricity generated by the wind is fed into power grids in more than 80 countries. By the end of 2014 24 countries already enjoyed over 1000 MW of installed capacity. Wind power now generates around 3% of the world's electricity and this figure is expected to rise to over 15% by 2030.

## What Is Tidal Energy And How Is It Harnessed? » Science ABC
 · Various setups used to harness energy from tides. Tidal Barrages: A tidal barrage is a dam that taps the potential energy generated by the difference in the height of the high tide and the low tide. The gates of the barrages are kept closed when it is high tide. This results in the water accumulating on one side of the dam.

## How Does Wind Turbine Generate Electricity 
 · The concept of harnessing wind power to generate mechanical energy goes back for millennia. In the early days people relied on windmills to grind grain pump water and cut wood at sawmills. Today's wind turbines are the windmill's modern equivalent that converts the kinetic energy in the wind into eco-friendly and clean renewable electricity.
