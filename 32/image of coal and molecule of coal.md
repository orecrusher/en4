 · Soft coal is also known as brown coal or lignite. China produces more hard coal than any other country by a factor of about three. The whopping 3162 million metric tons of hard coal produced by China dwarfs the output of the second and third-ranked producers—the U.S. at 932 million metric tons and India at 538 million metric tons.

## What is coal? 
Coal is a sedimentary deposit composed predominantly of carbon that is readily combustible. Coal is black or brownish-black and has a composition that (including inherent moisture) consists of more than 50 percent by weight and more than 70 percent by volume of carbonaceous material. It is formed from plant remains that have been compacted hardened chemically altered and

Coal is a solid black readily combustible fossil fuel that contains a large amount of carbon-based material - approximately 50% of its weight. The formation of coal takes a significant amount of time (on the order of a few million years) and the first coal-bearing rock units appeared about million years ago at a time known as the Carboniferous or "coal-bearing" Period.
