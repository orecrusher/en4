## Write scientific reason. Pine oil is used in froth 
Pine oil is hydrophobic. The particles of the metal sulphide ores which are hydrophobic get wetted by pine oil. They float with the foam on the surface of water. Thus by using this property some ores which contain hydrophobic particles in them can be concentrated by froth floatation process. Hence pine oil is used in froth floatation.

## The Appliion of Xanthate in Froth Flotation Process 
 · Xanthate as the flotation collector with strong collection effect is mainly used to enhance the hydrophobicity of the mineral surface to meet the requirements of flotation.Xanthate is commonly used in the flotation process of sulfide minerals. Xanthate is a combination of alcohol sodium hydroxide and carbon dioxide which is an anionic collector.

## Froth Flotation 
Froth flotation for separating discrete mineral particles from gangue was developed in the early 1900s and depends upon differences in the surface chemistry of the mineral species involved. We have studied not only the flotation of sulfides gold ores iron ores coal oil shale and many other nonmetallics but also soluble salts oxides and some uncommon materials from waste streams.

 · Minimise the amount of air in your oil when it's hot. Aim to filter oil when it is cooler (around 50°C) and remember to cover vats when they are not in use. Avoid excessive water on the surface of food. For example it's good practice to dry chips before introducing them to the fryer. Turn off your frying vats when they are not in use.

## Froth Treatment Explained 
 · Froth Treatment is a process by which water and fine solids are removed from bitumen froth using hydrocarbon-based gravity separation. There are two different types of hydrocarbons used in Froth Treatment: a naphtha-based hydrocarbon and a lighter paraffinic solvent. Both produce a relatively clean bitumen product but only a paraffinic process produces a marketable product stream.
