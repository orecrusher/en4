## A Simple Guide to Concrete Cube Testing
Before the concrete is scooped into the moulds the moulds must be lightly coated in a mould release agent. This ensures that the concrete does not stick to the mould and makes it easier to remove the cube. When using a 150mm mould the concrete sample is scooped into the mould in 3 equal layers (50mm) and compacted between each layer.
