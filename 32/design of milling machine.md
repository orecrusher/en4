 · Milling is an important process of manufacturing technology and basically it refers to the removal of metal from the work piece using a tool which has several cutting points and is rotating about its axis. Thus each cutting point removes a little bit of the metal but since there are multiple such points and the tool is rotating at a fast speed the overall removal is quite brisk.

## Principle and Working of MILLING MACHINE 
 · Introduction: Milling is the cutting operation that removes metal by feeding the work against a rotating cutter having single or multiple cutting edges. Flat or curved surfaces of many shapes can be machined by milling with good finish and accuracy. A milling machine may also be used for drilling slotting making a circular profile and gear cutting by having suitable attachments.

## Introduction to CNC machining 
Most machining parameters are determined by the machine operator during the generation of the G-code and are usually of little interest to the designer. The machine parameters of interest are the build size and the accuracy of the CNC machine: CNC machines have a large build area.

## The Mechanism and Kinematics of a Pantograph Milling Machine
The pantograph mechanism is used to design and fabrie a milling machine which could traverse on any contour provided that stylus is moved along the same on any already existing object. Using such kind of manipulator we can generate the de-scaled replica of the object or we can say it to be a copying machine which can be employed in mass production with economical production/machining cost.

The appliion of individual components in the milling machine design must be monitored because of the mechanical load affecting individual parts. For this reason defined and monitored parameters within the design include for example individual fixed elements the acting forces and the material properties of individual parts. In fact the material properties are one of the main criteria
