## Baryte 
Baryte is a light blue ore that spawns at 1000m to 2000m below. It is fairly common while mining downwards. Baryte can be found both in caves and on its own however it is a little more common in caves around 1100m. It is a very fast ore to mine like lower level ores such as sapphire and ruby. At Legend rank or lower it is a good idea to mine
