Weakly metamorphosed iron-formation is extremely fine-grained and requires very fine grinding (as fine as 0.03 mm in some cases) to liberate iron minerals from gangue. More highly metamorphosed ore is coarser-grained and requires less grinding. The maximum grain size after grinding is generally about 0.1 mm even for the most coarse-grained ore.

## Iron_ore 
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in colour from dark grey bright yellow deep purple to rusty red. The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) hematite (Fe 2 O 3) goethite limonite or siderite.Hematite is also known as "natural ore".
