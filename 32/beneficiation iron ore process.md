## Beneficiation of Oolitic Iron Ores 
 · Mineral processing of the ore to generate a commercial iron ore concentrate is very challenging due to the nature of these ores. Accordingly Hatch and Ironstone are developing a new pyrometallurgical process (Hatch Ironstone Chloride Segregation) to produce metallic iron from high silica and high phosphorus oolitic iron ores.

## Iron ore 
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey bright yellow or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 72.4% Fe) hematite (Fe 2 O 3 69.9% Fe) goethite (FeO(OH) 62.9% Fe) limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O) 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO
