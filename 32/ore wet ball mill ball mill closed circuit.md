## AMIT 135: Lesson 6 Grinding Circuit – Mining Mill Operator 
AG/SAG mills are normally used to grind run-off-mine ore or primary crusher product. Wet grinding in an AG/SAG mill is accomplished in a slurry of 50 to 80 percent solids. AG/SAG milling can often be accomplished with fewer lines than in a conventional rod mill/ball mill circuit. Closed Vertimill Circuit with Integral Classifier.

 · Each mill measures about 12 metres in diameter and has an internal volume of 1220 cubic metres. As the AG mill turns the ore crushes against itself and breaks apart. From the AG mills the ore travels to the primary magnetic separators where the iron is drawn away from the waste material before it's screened and fed into the ball mills.

Conical Ball Mills Used wet or dry closed or open circuit conical ball mills provide a classifying action within the body of the mill due to particles of greater size tending to reside at a point of greater diameter. This characteristic delivers increased efficiency and lower power consumption. Conical mills may also be air-swept when run dry.

Autogenous Mills operate mechanically similar to the ball mill. They differ in the media they use to break or grind the ore. Autogenous Mills use large particles of ore instead of steel or other balls for grinding media. Autogenous mills use large pieces of ore as grinding media. The grinding is facilitated in autogenous mills by attrition

## Ball Mills 
Ball Mills are generally used to grind material 1/4 inch and finer down to the particle size of 20 to 75 microns. To achieve a reasonable efficiency with ball mills they must be operated in a closed system with oversize material continuously being recirculated back into the mill to be reduced. Various classifiers such as screens spiral

## Estimated Water Requirements for the Conventional 
The crushed ore is transferred to a semiautogenous (SAG) mill or ball mill where the ore is further reduced in size. Water is added to the ball mill in which a slurry that usually contains from about 20 to 55 percent solids is produced (Singh 2010; International Mining 2011) (see fig. 2). The mill operates in a closed circuit with screens

## Rod mills how they function 
Rod mills are very similar to ball mills except they use long rods for grinding media. The rods grind the ore by tumbling within the the mill similar to the grinding balls in a ball mill. To prevent the conditions leading to rod charge tangling the length to diameter ratio is maintained at 1.4 to 1.6.

 · Closed circuit grinding system. See the advantages of closed circuit grinding. The method of installing a bowl classifier to overcome the difficulty is shown in Fig. 27. This circuit is usually adopted in modern practice but with a bowl instead of a straight classifier if necessary in the closed circuit of the secondary ball mill.
