## How Does a Surface Grinder Work? 
Surface grinding is the most common type of grinding process. It is a fixture in heavy industry where various kinds of metal and non-metal objects need to be refined and smoothed for a finishing process. This is most often seen in the automotive industry. A surface grinder consists of a table above which is held the abrasive wheel.
