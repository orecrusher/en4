## Copper Mining and Extraction: Oxide Ores
Copper Mining and Extraction: Oxide Ores. Copper is refined from ores in the ground either through underground or open-pit mines. Most of the copper ores mined today are oxide or sulfide ores. Extraction of sulfide ores is covered in more detail in Copper Mining and Extraction: Sulfide Ores (11–14) but is introduced here because an

Extraction of Metals. Extraction of Copper.. Copper is sometimes found as native metal.. Copper ores include copper(II) oxide and copper(II) sulfide. Copper(II) oxide can be reduced by reaction with carbon.. Some copper ores may contain only small amounts of copper. These are called low grade ores and have less than 1% copper but they are still used because copper is so valuable.

Copper can be extracted from its ore by: Underground: sinking a vertical shaft into the Earth to an appropriate depth and driving horizontal tunnels into the ore. Open pit: 90% of ore is mined by this method. Ores near the surface can be quarried after removal of the surface layers.
