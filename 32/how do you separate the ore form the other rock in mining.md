 · In surface mining approximately 2--3 tons of waste rock is removed for each ton of ore. Underground mining generally creates less waste rock than surface mining; the waste rock is either moved to the surface or used to fill in areas of the mine no longer in use. Piles of waste rock are usually deposited close to the mine.

## What are the different types of mining and how do they differ?
 · Open-Pit. As the name suggests open pit mining involves mining minerals or ore that can be found near the surface layer of the site. That being said some quarries can be over 1000 meters deep. This form of mining doesn't require tunnelling into the earth and is a simple method of mining that yields

## Surface mining planning and design of open pit mining
 · Although the basic concept of an open pit is quite simple the planning required to develop a large deposit for surface mining is a very complex and costly undertaking. At one mine it may be desirable to plan for blending variations in the ore so as to maintain as nearly as possible a uniform feed to the mill. At another operation it may be desirable to completely separate two kinds of ore

## Copper Mining and Extraction Sulfide Ores
The main ores of copper are sulfides and oxides. From their chemical formulas you can calculate the percentage of copper in each mineral. However this is not the same as the percentage of copper in the ore as that also contains unwanted silies and other minerals called gangue that will have to be separated.

 · After mining large pieces of the ore feed are broken through crushing and/or grinding. This step creates particles that are either mostly valuable or mostly waste. TConcentrating the particles of value in a form supporting separation enables the desired metal to be removed from waste products.

Because open-pit mining is employed for ore deposits at a substantial depth underground it usually involves the creation of a pit that extends below the groundwater table. In this case groundwater must be pumped out of the pit to allow mining to take place. A pit lake usually forms at some point in time after mining stops and

## Mining and Mineral Use 
Surface mining allows extraction of ores that are close to Earth's surface. Overlying rock is blasted and the rock that contains the valuable minerals is placed in a truck and taken to a refinery. As pictured in Figure below surface mining includes open-pit mining and mountaintop removal. Other methods of surface mining include strip mining

6.1.1 Lead and Zinc Ore Mining Lead and zinc ore is nearly always mined below the surface of the ground. Some veins of ore lie as deep as several thousand feet but most deposits lie close to the surface. Lead and zinc ore is mined almost exclusively in underground operations though a few surface operations do exist.
