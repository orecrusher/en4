## Types of milling cutters and processing characteristics
 · In the process of milling due to the complex shape of the workpiece itself taking into account factors such as cutting efficiency tool life and workpiece shape it is usually necessary to use different shapes and different types of milling cutters for processing. Generally mold processing is the most commonly used There are three types of knives: end mills ball mills and round nose mills.

## Metallography of Steels
metallography of steels. It is sometimes the case that a pearlitic steel is too strong for the purposes of machining or other processing. It can then be heat-treated at a temperature below that at which austenite forms to allow the cementite to spheroidise.

Process The condition of the material at hand determines what type of abrasive will be applied. The first stage if the material is unfinished starts with a rough abrasive (perhaps 60 or 80 grit) and each subsequent stage uses a finer abrasive such as 120 180 220/240 320 400 and higher grit abrasives until the desired finish is achieved.
