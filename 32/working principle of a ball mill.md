Small balls give more point contacts but larger balls give greater impact. As with all grinding mills working surfaces gradually wear so product contamination must be guarded against. At low speeds of rotation the balls are not lifted very far up the walls of the cylinder. The balls tumble over each other and shear forces predominate.

 · In roller mills the principle of attrition is used where material is sheared as it passes through a gap and is transferred from slower roll to a faster roll and is removed by a scraper. In ball mill size reduction is done by both impact and attrition of particles. Rod mill is similar to ball mills but it uses long rods for grinding media.
